This was from a LessWrong article about the 
[problems with education](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/h5z/problems_in_education/).

Although this article outlines the problems with the way funds are distributed
to our schools through grants, it is a problem with human nature.

Once we create a solution to a problem, we judge the success of our endeavours
by the success with which we execute our solution instead of judging based on
the *metrics that define the problem*.

The short answer: measure everything, and evaluate results based on the
evidence.
