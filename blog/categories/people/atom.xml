    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Salman Rushdie is an amazing author. His books produce magic in ways that I
can't explain in a blog post.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed this talk:</p>

<p>And I particularly enjoy this quote from <em>Midnight's Children</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before
me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone
everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am
anything that happens after I've gone which would not have happened if I had
not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each "I," every
one of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude.
I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you'll have to swallow a world.</p></blockquote>
