One of the most exciting things about Facebook Home is that Facebook is
releasing a phone in partnership with HTC.

Although I don’t personally use a smart phone, it is fascinating to think about
the change this could bring.

SMS used to be a big deal before the iPhone. It’s only very recently that
social networking has taken over communication, although SMS is still used for
communication that needs to be instant.

The key question for the future: how much will the lines between phone calls,
SMS, and Facebook messaging blur? How long will it take before Facebook
establishes itself as an identity on the same level as a phone number?
