When I first read about the research of [Martin Seligman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman), I was skeptical. He
is famous for coming up with the concept of "learned helplessness," but more
recently has been instrumental in forming a type of psychology known as
positive psychology. Positive psychology is all about using behavior as a way
to produce positive changes in mood. It's the opposite of learned helplessness:
learned optimism.

I listened to [his speech at the RSA](http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/flourish), and
started doing a simple daily exercise he recommends: writing down 3 good things that
happened during the day and why they happened. 

That simple exercise has produced lower levels of depression and higher levels
of psychological well-being in placebo-controlled studies. It's so simple that
it almost feels a little silly while doing it, but I recommend trying it out.
It quickly becomes engaging, and it is really interesting to go back in time
and smile at the things that made me happy.
