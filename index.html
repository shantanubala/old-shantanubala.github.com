  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier&#8217;s Blog</a> is an ecellent web site to
read, especially if you are interested in issues related to security. Although
a lot of his writing can be very technical, there are a few of his essays that
make complex ideas easier to understand. One of my favorite posts from his blog
is <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/security_vs_pri.html">Security vs. Privacy</a>, an
analysis of the false dilemma that is often constructed between national
security and individual privacy.</p>

<p>Not all security measures need to violate privacy, and not all violations of
privacy lead to increased levels of security. An attempt to frame security and
privacy as two opposing forces is misinformed at its best and pernicious at its
worst.</p>

<p>To put it a step further, invasions of privacy are often attempts to profile
people. By establishing patterns that describe a <em>typical terrorist</em>, we can
narrow our searches and focus on people who actually exhibit behavior that
resembles known terrorists. The standard argument is, &#8220;if you have nothing to
hide, why should you care?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although privacy is important for its own sake, using personal information like
Internet usage or private emails to find suspected terrorists is <em>not a very
good idea</em>. A person with the desire to execute a complex terror plot will
probably not send vital information over an unencrypted channel. Unless the
NSA can outsmart <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>,
the invasions of privacy will only foil terror plots conducted by
unsophisticated groups. The benefits associated with sacrifices of privacy
would be marginal at best. The end result will be an ocean of information
available to government agencies about
ordinary people without the knowledge to protect themselves.</p>

<p>This is the same reason why pilots have to go through airport security. Even
though a pilot can crash the plane, the security concern is not about the
potential damage a pilot can cause. The security concern is about whether the
pilot <em>is actually a pilot</em>. When designing a security system, the security of
the whole system is only as good as the weakest link. If pilots don&#8217;t have to go
through ordinary security lines, a terrorist would only need a pilot&#8217;s uniform
and badge to go through security undetected.</p>

<p>Likewise, if we use people&#8217;s private information, whether it&#8217;s emails or Facebook
activity, we should be careful not to create a tiered security system. If a
potential terrorist only needs to act normal on Facebook in order to avoid
the government&#8217;s attention, monitoring Facebook accounts will not actually
provide more security.</p>

<p>Security is always a matter of cost and benefit, but privacy is rarely an
effective price to pay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m two weeks into the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Stanford Machine Learning course</a>
taught by Andrew Ng through Coursera.</p>

<p>The class is excellent, and I&#8217;m having a great time going through the material.
Coursera&#8217;s platform not only makes it really easy to watch the lectures, but
the material in the course is taught really well.</p>

<p>Overall, the experience has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p>There are two types of assignments in the class: lecture review questions and
programming exercises. The lecture review questions are multiple choice
questions you complete online, and the programming exercises are
automatically-graded code exercises that focus on Octave.</p>

<p>So far, the material has been relatively simple, and the course has only
covered a brief introduction to the topic of Machine Learning as well as linear
regression with a single or multiple variables. The Octave programming language
has also been introduced, but the course is still progressing quite well.</p>

<p>The high quality of the course and the amazing price tag (free!) seem to be
signalling pretty big changes in education coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://personalmba.com/">The Personal MBA</a> by Josh Kaufman is probably one of
the best business books I&#8217;ve read. I usually don&#8217;t enjoy reading business
books, but Kaufman does an excellent job of being precise and concise in his
explanations of terminology and strategy.</p>

<p>In short, a business is a repeatable process that:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>creates or provides something of value that</li>
<li>other people want or need</li>
<li>at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that</li>
<li>satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and</li>
<li>provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As Kaufman says, everything else is a hobby.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://sivers.org/book/PersonalMBA">Derek Sivers&#8217; review</a> of the book
is a very good summary, the book itself is a must-read for anyone who wants to
start a business.</p>

<p>A few key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test everything. Any assumption that is untested should be questioned unless
there is external evidence (e.g. science) that validates the assumption.</li>
<li>Business is all about creating value and extracting a portion of the value
that is created.</li>
<li>There are two things your business does: things that provide value and waste.</li>
<li>We are inherently biased towards the things we create. External validation is
crucial.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t delay a launch in search of perfection, but iterate towards it over
time.</li>
<li>Measure the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring a customer
through different channels. Once these variables are measured, and the cost
of acquiring a customer is less than the lifetime value, profits will be easy
to increase.</li>
<li>Test prices. Higher prices are usually not as bad as you may think.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most valuable things I have ever read is the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> sequence
<a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">How To Actually Change Your Mind</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend it without hesitation to anyone who hasn&#8217;t already read it.</p>

<p>Here are some gems:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you see people insisting that no amount of money whatsoever is worth a
single human life, and then driving an extra mile to save $10; or when you
see people insisting that no amount of money is worth a decrement of health,
and then choosing the cheapest health insurance available; then you don&#8217;t
think that their protestations reveal some deep truth about incommensurable
utilities.</p>

<p>In the West, there is a saying: &#8220;The squaky wheel gets the grease.&#8221; In Japan,
the corresponding saying runs: &#8220;The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe there was a lawsuit where someone alleged that the draft lottery
was unfair, because the slips with names on them were not being mixed
thoroughly enough; and the judge replied, &#8220;To whom is it unfair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we cannot learn to take joy in the merely real, our lives will be empty
indeed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire sequence is very long, but also worth reading through. It is the
kind of thing that changes the way you think, and it includes numerous
interesting footnotes and citations that provide an endless rabbit hole of
thought-provoking content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on my ability to remember information. Instead of using memory
&#8220;tricks&#8221; like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_%28psychology%29">chunking</a>, I&#8217;m
working on simply using a &#8220;brute force&#8221; approach to storing information in
long term memory using flash cards.</p>

<p>Although this isn&#8217;t the most efficient way to remember information, it&#8217;s the
best way to remember information <em>unintentionally</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with the method of loci and chunking is simple: those techniques
only provide you with access to information within the context of the
technique. The method of loci makes memorizing information very easy, but you
need to focus on visualizing a spatial location to access your memories.
Chunking groups small pieces of information into larger parts, but what if you
need an individual piece at a random time?</p>

<p>The problem with a lot of memory techniques is that they don&#8217;t address the main
issue with memory: when is it useful to know the information? Chunking and the
method of loci are useful for memorizing a speech or for situations when you
know in advance that you will need a piece of information.</p>

<p>What if I need information, but I can&#8217;t predict when or how that need will
arise?</p>

<p>The best way, in that situation, is to create as many associations with
related things as possible. As a result, I&#8217;m giving a few different flash card
tools a try. With these tools, I&#8217;m attempting to memorize maps of the world,
vocabulary words, historical events, and animal species. To make the process as
effective as possible, I&#8217;m working on creating a set of images from Flickr
corresponding to each of the words, and the flash cards will have multiple
&#8220;definitions&#8221; that can point to a single word.</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve enjoyed using the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> - a downloadable tool that tracks the intervals
between correct and incorrect recall to maximize the probability of
successfully storing a flash card in long term memory</li>
<li><a href="http://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> - a web-based social tool with thousands of
existing sets of flash cards that are ripe for memorizing and learning</li>
<li><a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> - a newer and sleeker web-based tool with
fewer flash cards available to study, but incorporates gamification and
tracking of accuracy to maximize recall</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert - this is a science fiction book involving
intergalactic politics and complicated plots</li>
<li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman - this is a nonfiction book
written by a Nobel Prize winner in economics about how we make sense of
information and form conclusions</li>
<li><em>Titan</em> by Ron Chernow - this is a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. that
is unfortunately dry at times, but has some great stories</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to get in the habit of reviewing books, so this is my way of holding
myself accountable: I&#8217;ll post reviews by the end of May.</p>

<p>And I particularly enjoy this quote from <em>Midnight&#8217;s Children</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before
me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone
everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am
anything that happens after I&#8217;ve gone which would not have happened if I had
not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each &#8220;I,&#8221; every
one of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude.
I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you&#8217;ll have to swallow a world.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The specific project I was evaluating had only gotten $800,000 out of the
maximum $2m. Its strategy was to purchase the male students iPod Touches, the
female students makeovers, manicures, and pedicures at a local beauty parlor,
and all students were offered an additional iPod Touch or Makeover,
respectively, if they passed the exam at the end of the current year. The
grant proposal had specifically listed these actions as being the goal of the
proposal. If the iPods and makeovers were purchased, that constituted
success.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was from a LessWrong article about the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/h5z/problems_in_education/">problems with education</a>.</p>

<p>Although this article outlines the problems with the way funds are distributed
to our schools through grants, it is a problem with human nature.</p>

<p>Once we create a solution to a problem, we judge the success of our endeavours
by the success with which we execute our solution instead of judging based on
the <em>metrics that define the problem</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished re-reading all of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#8217;s Harry Potter fanfic -
<a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>. After reading
it again, I have a new appreciation for what Eliezer is attempting.</p>

<p>Writing fan fiction based on a series as popular as Harry Potter allows Eliezer
to construct a new world from existing parts. Instead of having to spend
enormous amounts of time establishing the histories and personalities of his
characters, he can focus only on the parts that are <em>different</em> from the
original work. It is through these differences that Eliezer is able to explain
seemingly-complex concepts involving Bayesian Rationality, quantum mechanics,
cognitive biases, and psychology.</p>

<p>The references to science seem forced at times, but the underlying story is
gripping in a way that is very different from J.K. Rowling&#8217;s writing. Eliezer
has elevated the art of fan fiction to a different level - instead of just
constructing a story that extends the original, he constructs a story that
transcends it.</p>

<p>Give it a shot. It&#8217;s worth reading.</p>
