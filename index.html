  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p> Inspiration is frequently misunderstood. When I was a young writer I looked
 for it in all the wrong places. In my twenties, I lived with my wife in a
 studio apartment just off Washington Square. Somehow I decided that the best
 writing time for me was late at night–I guessed that was when the muses
 would be running wild and delivering intoxicating poetic secrets. Perhaps I
 got this impression from Thelonious Monk’s ‘Round about Midnight” which I
 played over and over–it was so hauntingly beautiful and sad. In those days,
 after a late heavy dinner with a couple of beers topped off by more than a
 few drags of weed, I took my yellow legal pad into the chilly unsightly
 stairwell across from my front door and got ready to write the great
 American novel. Ugh, wrong move, Waitz. I recall sitting in the stairwell
 waiting for inspiration to strike until I was dozing off or feeling too
 cold. Some evenings when my wife was off taking classes at N.Y.U., for
 inspiration I maxed out the hifi with Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane
 blasting pure madness solos while I tried to compose my delicate pages.
 Wrong. Wrong. All wrong, Waitzkin.</p>

<p> Now, many years later, when I’m working on a book I write everyday except
 Sunday, when I watch football or go to the country with my wife. This routine
 has settled deeply inside. It gives me confidence. I’ve learned that pages
 will come if I go to my quiet office and stick with my routine. Back in the
 younger days, the unsightly stairwell seemed cool, but not now. I could never
 do my best work after a heavy meal or with the music blasting. It would be a
 distraction–an energy robber.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/03/24/the-alchemy-of-writing-tips-from-a-non-fiction-and-fiction-pro/">an interview between Tim Ferris and Fred Waitzkin</a>
with Waitzkin discussing inspiration.</p>

<p>Inspiration is often seen as a kind of &#8220;eureka moment&#8221; where great ideas
suddenly materialize. We view inspiration as an instantaneous event.
Inspiration either happens, or it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>The examples are everywhere. If you look at Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook was not
his only success. Facebook was a culmination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg#Software_developer">years of software development</a>
throughout his teens. He didn&#8217;t randomly realize the power of the Internet and
then decide to build a social network. He spent years on the Internet before
realizing its potential uses. He spent years programming before building
something great.</p>

<p>If you dislike anecdotal evidence (for good reasons!), there is <em>empirical
evidence</em> to support this claim. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#Behavior">Conscientousness has positive effects on life outcomes</a>
according to a variety of different measurements. The desire for excellence and
a willingness to do hard work is a key factor in determining success.</p>

<p>Effectively, our intuitive notions of inspiration may just be a byproduct of
our inability to consciously trace the origins of our best ideas. Instead of
attempting to replicate the actions that led us to good ideas, we are caught in
trying to replicate the <em>situations</em> that led us to good ideas. This is
reflected by the fundamental attribution error: when we see other people&#8217;s
successes, we associate the results with a property of the people themselves, but when we
see our own successes, we associate the results with the situation we are in.</p>

<p>The hardest part of creative work is <em>starting</em> and <em>continuing</em> the work.
&#8220;Inspiration&#8221; is the easy part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed an <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment.html#comment-478842490">excellent comment on Marissa Mayer&#8217;s blog</a>
about the nature of burnout.</p>

<blockquote><p>Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or
effort into high-risk problems that fail.  It&#8217;s the result of a negative
prediction error in the nucleus accumbens.  You effectively condition your
brain to associate work with failure.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, then eventually, consciously, you wonder if it&#8217;s worth it.
The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing
small things that you know are going to work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many times, burnout is attributed to working too hard. Though this is certainly
a cause, it is important to understand that the burnout is more likely to occur
if the work isn&#8217;t <em>rewarded</em> in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>This is the reason why people are willing to sink hundreds of hours into video
games doing seemingly boring tasks like mining for gold. The behavior gets
rewarded within the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules">according to a schedule</a>
that optimizes for addiction. The banality of the task is offset by the
instantaneous rewards provided by the system.</p>

<p>As described in the comment, the key to avoiding burnout is not necessarily
just to reduce workload. The key to avoiding burnout appears to be the use of
small guaranteed successes as a way to offset the cognitive impact of large
failures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier&#8217;s Blog</a> is an ecellent web site to
read, especially if you are interested in issues related to security. Although
a lot of his writing can be very technical, there are a few of his essays that
make complex ideas easier to understand. One of my favorite posts from his blog
is <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/security_vs_pri.html">Security vs. Privacy</a>, an
analysis of the false dilemma that is often constructed between national
security and individual privacy.</p>

<p>Not all security measures need to violate privacy, and not all violations of
privacy lead to increased levels of security. An attempt to frame security and
privacy as two opposing forces is misinformed at its best and pernicious at its
worst.</p>

<p>To put it a step further, invasions of privacy are often attempts to profile
people. By establishing patterns that describe a <em>typical terrorist</em>, we can
narrow our searches and focus on people who actually exhibit behavior that
resembles known terrorists. The standard argument is, &#8220;if you have nothing to
hide, why should you care?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although privacy is important for its own sake, using personal information like
Internet usage or private emails to find suspected terrorists is <em>not a very
good idea</em>. A person with the desire to execute a complex terror plot will
probably not send vital information over an unencrypted channel. Unless the
NSA can outsmart <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>,
the invasions of privacy will only foil terror plots conducted by
unsophisticated groups. The benefits associated with sacrifices of privacy
would be marginal at best. The end result will be an ocean of information
available to government agencies about
ordinary people without the knowledge to protect themselves.</p>

<p>This is the same reason why pilots have to go through airport security. Even
though a pilot can crash the plane, the security concern is not about the
potential damage a pilot can cause. The security concern is about whether the
pilot <em>is actually a pilot</em>. When designing a security system, the security of
the whole system is only as good as the weakest link. If pilots don&#8217;t have to go
through ordinary security lines, a terrorist would only need a pilot&#8217;s uniform
and badge to go through security undetected.</p>

<p>Likewise, if we use people&#8217;s private information, whether it&#8217;s emails or Facebook
activity, we should be careful not to create a tiered security system. If a
potential terrorist only needs to act normal on Facebook in order to avoid
the government&#8217;s attention, monitoring Facebook accounts will not actually
provide more security.</p>

<p>Security is always a matter of cost and benefit, but privacy is rarely an
effective price to pay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m two weeks into the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Stanford Machine Learning course</a>
taught by Andrew Ng through Coursera.</p>

<p>The class is excellent, and I&#8217;m having a great time going through the material.
Coursera&#8217;s platform not only makes it really easy to watch the lectures, but
the material in the course is taught really well.</p>

<p>Overall, the experience has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p>There are two types of assignments in the class: lecture review questions and
programming exercises. The lecture review questions are multiple choice
questions you complete online, and the programming exercises are
automatically-graded code exercises that focus on Octave.</p>

<p>So far, the material has been relatively simple, and the course has only
covered a brief introduction to the topic of Machine Learning as well as linear
regression with a single or multiple variables. The Octave programming language
has also been introduced, but the course is still progressing quite well.</p>

<p>The high quality of the course and the amazing price tag (free!) seem to be
signalling pretty big changes in education coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://personalmba.com/">The Personal MBA</a> by Josh Kaufman is probably one of
the best business books I&#8217;ve read. I usually don&#8217;t enjoy reading business
books, but Kaufman does an excellent job of being precise and concise in his
explanations of terminology and strategy.</p>

<p>In short, a business is a repeatable process that:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>creates or provides something of value that</li>
<li>other people want or need</li>
<li>at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that</li>
<li>satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and</li>
<li>provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As Kaufman says, everything else is a hobby.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://sivers.org/book/PersonalMBA">Derek Sivers&#8217; review</a> of the book
is a very good summary, the book itself is a must-read for anyone who wants to
start a business.</p>

<p>A few key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test everything. Any assumption that is untested should be questioned unless
there is external evidence (e.g. science) that validates the assumption.</li>
<li>Business is all about creating value and extracting a portion of the value
that is created.</li>
<li>There are two things your business does: things that provide value and waste.</li>
<li>We are inherently biased towards the things we create. External validation is
crucial.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t delay a launch in search of perfection, but iterate towards it over
time.</li>
<li>Measure the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring a customer
through different channels. Once these variables are measured, and the cost
of acquiring a customer is less than the lifetime value, profits will be easy
to increase.</li>
<li>Test prices. Higher prices are usually not as bad as you may think.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most valuable things I have ever read is the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> sequence
<a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">How To Actually Change Your Mind</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend it without hesitation to anyone who hasn&#8217;t already read it.</p>

<p>Here are some gems:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you see people insisting that no amount of money whatsoever is worth a
single human life, and then driving an extra mile to save $10; or when you
see people insisting that no amount of money is worth a decrement of health,
and then choosing the cheapest health insurance available; then you don&#8217;t
think that their protestations reveal some deep truth about incommensurable
utilities.</p>

<p>In the West, there is a saying: &#8220;The squaky wheel gets the grease.&#8221; In Japan,
the corresponding saying runs: &#8220;The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe there was a lawsuit where someone alleged that the draft lottery
was unfair, because the slips with names on them were not being mixed
thoroughly enough; and the judge replied, &#8220;To whom is it unfair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we cannot learn to take joy in the merely real, our lives will be empty
indeed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire sequence is very long, but also worth reading through. It is the
kind of thing that changes the way you think, and it includes numerous
interesting footnotes and citations that provide an endless rabbit hole of
thought-provoking content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on my ability to remember information. Instead of using memory
&#8220;tricks&#8221; like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_%28psychology%29">chunking</a>, I&#8217;m
working on simply using a &#8220;brute force&#8221; approach to storing information in
long term memory using flash cards.</p>

<p>Although this isn&#8217;t the most efficient way to remember information, it&#8217;s the
best way to remember information <em>unintentionally</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with the method of loci and chunking is simple: those techniques
only provide you with access to information within the context of the
technique. The method of loci makes memorizing information very easy, but you
need to focus on visualizing a spatial location to access your memories.
Chunking groups small pieces of information into larger parts, but what if you
need an individual piece at a random time?</p>

<p>The problem with a lot of memory techniques is that they don&#8217;t address the main
issue with memory: when is it useful to know the information? Chunking and the
method of loci are useful for memorizing a speech or for situations when you
know in advance that you will need a piece of information.</p>

<p>What if I need information, but I can&#8217;t predict when or how that need will
arise?</p>

<p>The best way, in that situation, is to create as many associations with
related things as possible. As a result, I&#8217;m giving a few different flash card
tools a try. With these tools, I&#8217;m attempting to memorize maps of the world,
vocabulary words, historical events, and animal species. To make the process as
effective as possible, I&#8217;m working on creating a set of images from Flickr
corresponding to each of the words, and the flash cards will have multiple
&#8220;definitions&#8221; that can point to a single word.</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve enjoyed using the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> - a downloadable tool that tracks the intervals
between correct and incorrect recall to maximize the probability of
successfully storing a flash card in long term memory</li>
<li><a href="http://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> - a web-based social tool with thousands of
existing sets of flash cards that are ripe for memorizing and learning</li>
<li><a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> - a newer and sleeker web-based tool with
fewer flash cards available to study, but incorporates gamification and
tracking of accuracy to maximize recall</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert - this is a science fiction book involving

<li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman - this is a nonfiction book
written by a Nobel Prize winner in economics about how we make sense of

is unfortunately dry at times, but has some great stories</li>
