The following is an excerpt from [this article](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/) on Fox News.

> As the author of three books on the American family and its intersection with pop culture, I’ve spent thirteen years examining social agendas as they pertain to sex, parenting, and gender roles. During this time, I’ve spoken with hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women. And in doing so, I’ve accidentally stumbled upon a subculture of men who’ve told me, in no uncertain terms, that they’re never getting married. When I ask them why, the answer is always the same.

> Women aren’t women anymore.

How do they know so confidently that "women aren't women anymore" if they've never been married? Actually, the word "never" is important: this demographic of men is probably too young to even remember what women *were* to begin with. If a man is well over 40, *never* getting married will be discussed in the *past tense*, and it's only these men who have any right to say something about what women were like in a previous generation. If a person was not alive, how would they know what women *were* like?

The alternate explanation: this has nothing to do with the current generation of women, and everything to do with the men she's interviewing. "Women aren't women anymore" just requires less self-analysis and an unbruised ego.
