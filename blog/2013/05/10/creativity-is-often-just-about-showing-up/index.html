<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p> Inspiration is frequently misunderstood. When I was a young writer I looked
 for it in all the wrong places. In my twenties, I lived with my wife in a
 studio apartment just off Washington Square. Somehow I decided that the best
 writing time for me was late at night–I guessed that was when the muses
 would be running wild and delivering intoxicating poetic secrets. Perhaps I
 got this impression from Thelonious Monk’s ‘Round about Midnight” which I
 played over and over–it was so hauntingly beautiful and sad. In those days,
 after a late heavy dinner with a couple of beers topped off by more than a
 few drags of weed, I took my yellow legal pad into the chilly unsightly
 stairwell across from my front door and got ready to write the great
 American novel. Ugh, wrong move, Waitz. I recall sitting in the stairwell
 waiting for inspiration to strike until I was dozing off or feeling too
 cold. Some evenings when my wife was off taking classes at N.Y.U., for
 inspiration I maxed out the hifi with Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane
 blasting pure madness solos while I tried to compose my delicate pages.
 Wrong. Wrong. All wrong, Waitzkin.</p>

<p> Now, many years later, when I’m working on a book I write everyday except
 Sunday, when I watch football or go to the country with my wife. This routine
 has settled deeply inside. It gives me confidence. I’ve learned that pages
 will come if I go to my quiet office and stick with my routine. Back in the
 younger days, the unsightly stairwell seemed cool, but not now. I could never
 do my best work after a heavy meal or with the music blasting. It would be a
 distraction–an energy robber.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/03/24/the-alchemy-of-writing-tips-from-a-non-fiction-and-fiction-pro/">an interview between Tim Ferris and Fred Waitzkin</a>
with Waitzkin discussing inspiration.</p>

<p>Inspiration is often seen as a kind of &#8220;eureka moment&#8221; where great ideas
suddenly materialize. We view inspiration as an instantaneous event.
Inspiration either happens, or it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>The examples are everywhere. If you look at Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook was not
his only success. Facebook was a culmination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg#Software_developer">years of software development</a>
throughout his teens. He didn&#8217;t randomly realize the power of the Internet and
then decide to build a social network. He spent years on the Internet before
realizing its potential uses. He spent years programming before building
something great.</p>

<p>If you dislike anecdotal evidence (for good reasons!), there is <em>empirical
evidence</em> to support this claim. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#Behavior">Conscientousness has positive effects on life outcomes</a>
according to a variety of different measurements. The desire for excellence and
a willingness to do hard work is a key factor in determining success.</p>

<p>Effectively, our intuitive notions of inspiration may just be a byproduct of
our inability to consciously trace the origins of our best ideas. Instead of
attempting to replicate the actions that led us to good ideas, we are caught in
trying to replicate the <em>situations</em> that led us to good ideas. This is
reflected by the fundamental attribution error: when we see other people&#8217;s
successes, we associate the results with a property of the people themselves, but when we
see our own successes, we associate the results with the situation we are in.</p>

<p>The hardest part of creative work is <em>starting</em> and <em>continuing</em> the work.
&#8220;Inspiration&#8221; is the easy part.</p>
