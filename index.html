<p>In the above video, Lawrence Krauss discusses the evidence of a universe that
is flat. Through the Friedmann Equations, which are a derivation of General
Relativity, one can use that evidence to extrapolate the fact that the universe
has a net energy density of 0. A while ago, I compiled a lot of information on the topic.
If you like learning about something with some depth, this blog post is a good follow-up to
the video.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The beginning of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, experimentation on the cosmic microwave background over the past 4 decades, and the construction of numerous different telescopes have provided the once-theoretical subject of cosmology experimental and observational evidence. Theoretical formulas dating back to Einstein&#8217;s Field Equations now have quantitative measurements associated with them. The subject of cosmology has always fascinated me – there is a vast expansive universe that the human species has yet to explore, but our understanding of physics has allowed us to comprehend many of the properties and traits of the universe as a whole. This paper attempts to combine the mathematical aspects of Einstein&#8217;s Field Equations with recent data collection efforts using modern satellites and telescopes to create a deeper understanding of the properties of the universe that determine is curvature (also referred to as the local geometry of the universe).</p>

<p>After the formulation of Einstein&#8217;s Field Equations and the theory of general relativity, scientists postulated that the universe as a whole may follow different local geometries based on its net energy. The Field Equations themselves only provided a mathematical basis for understanding the relationships between different properties of the universe; in order to determine the actual properties of the universe, observational evidence must be evaluated. Primarily, there is only one property of the universe that determines its curvature – its density as described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker model of the universe (a derivative of general relativity that treats the universe as a fluid). The curvature of the universe is entirely determined by the amount of matter and energy contained in the universe (“Cosmological Models”). The purpose of this paper is to answer the following question (specifically in relation to the density of the universe and the behavior of light and space depending on the universe&#8217;s density): to what extent does observational evidence support the hypothesis that the universe follows a flat Euclidean local geometry?</p>

<p>In order to investigate the aforementioned question, I will utilize data collected from telescopes examining supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation in conjunction with derivatives of Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity. In addition, I will present results of different approaches to collecting observations that indicate the local geometry of the universe. Since the density of the universe is equal the critical density of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker model, the local geometry of the universe is flat and the light and space in the universe behave accordingly. Primarily, this investigation assumes that the  Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker model, which derives from Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity, accurately models the properties of the universe.</p>

<h4>A Flat Universe</h4>

<p>The discovery of the cosmic background radiation in 1965, along with data collection and data analysis efforts spanning subsequent decades, produced not only support for the Big Bang theory as a whole, but also enabled scientists to observationally determine the geometry of the universe; in essence, the cosmic background radiation provided the observational basis for the conclusion that the universe follows a flat geometry (Tyson).</p>

<p>The cosmic background, currently microwave radiation, formed closely after the beginning of the Big Bang itself. It consists of a “a ubiquitous bath of photons” formed “from a dazzling, sizzling early universe.” Since the temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the volume of the universe, the average temperature cools as its volume increases, and heats as its volume decreases. After nearly 14 billion years, the photons formed at the origin of the universe now form microwave radiation due to the continuous expansion of space that caused the wavelength of the photons to expand to approximately 1 millimeter (the Hubble diagram depicts how the distance between two points in space increases over time). Since the amount of energy contained by photons is inversely proportional to its wavelength, the expansion of the universe causes the amount of energy carried by individual photons in the cosmic background radiation to decrease over time. Observations of the cosmic background radiation have not only indicated that the universe had a beginning, but also that the universe is continuously expanding. The molecule cyanogen (CN) is excited in the presence of microwave radiation (and excited proportionally to the amount of energy contained within the photons of the microwave radiation). Since the cosmic background radiation currently is in the microwave spectrum, the cyanogen present across galaxies will be excited by the background radiation. Since some galaxies are millions of light years farther away than other galaxies, the light emitted by the galaxies would arrive at Earth at different times, allowing an observer to see back in time. Observations of cyanogen-containing galaxies close and far away from the Milky Way indicate that the universe was smaller further back in time due to the increased excitement in cyanogen present in galaxies further away from the Earth (increased excitement indicates a smaller wavelength of microwave radiation, which results from smaller space in the universe). The afrementioned properties of the cosmic microwave background make it an excellent indicator of the properties of the universe from the time of its origin (Tyson).</p>

<p>In Einstein’s Field Equations in his theory of general relativity, the energy-momentum of the universe is set equal to the curvature of space. By treating the matter in space as a fluid, and using the mathematics of fluid dynamics to construct a solution to Einstein’s Field Equations (known as the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker model or the Standard Model of cosmology), simple 3-dimensional geometric models can be extrapolated that describe the possible curvature of multidimensional space based on the energy density of the universe. Although the Standard Model of cosmology assumes that the universe behaves as a fluid, even though gravitational forces produce large concentrated bodies of matter (galaxies), the assumption applies on an even larger scale (“Cosmological Models”). Individual galaxies constitute a very minute portion of the matter in the universe – according to the Las Campanas Redshift Survey of approximately 20,000 galaxies, there were very small variations in the concentrations of galaxies within small (less than tens of millions of light years) apertures (Lin). Similarly, measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background by the Cosmic Background Explorer indicate the predominant homogeneity of the universe (Greason). Although the probe detected minor inhomogeneities in isolated locations, the universe is mostly homogenous and isotropic when observed as a whole or on average. As a result, the universe conforms to the Standard Model of cosmology with very minute margins of error. Since the assumptions of the Standard Model of cosmology have been verified observationally, the equations that are part of the Standard Model must also accurately reflect the properties of the universe.</p>

<p>In order to extrapolate the 3-dimensional models of the geometry of the universe using the Standard Model of cosmology, the density parameter (the ratio between the observed density and the critical density) of the Friedmann equations (the equations derived in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann to describe the expansion of space in a homogenous and isotropic model with respect to general relativity) must be calculated (“Cosmological Models”). The critical density of the universe (or the average amount of energy per unit of volume) has been approximated to lie between 4.5×1030 and 1.8×1029 grams per cubic centimeter (Elert). The variance in this calculation is caused by the variations in the calculated Hubble Parameter, which is the rate at which space in the universe expands.Since the critical density refers to the density of the universe that provides for a Euclidean geometry, the density parameter serves as a numerical description of the geometry of the universe.</p>

<p>Depending on the value for the density parameter, the curvature of space can follow three different geometric patterns: curved and open, curved and closed, and flat. Each of these three local geometries carries a different implication concerning the properties of light and space in the universe. When solving the Friedmann equations, a density parameter less than 1 produces an open curved universe (otherwise known as a 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry). In an open curved universe, the universe would continuously expand forever, and light would diverge. A density parameter less than 1 produces a closed curved universe (otherwise known as a 3-dimensional spherical geometry), which causes light to converge. In a closed universe, space would expand until it collapses into itself – a process termed a “big crunch”. With a density parameter equal to 1, the universe would be flat. In a flat universe, the universe would expand, but eventually slow down in its expansion. In addition, a flat universe allows light to travel through a vacuum in a straight line (“Cosmological Models”).</p>

<p>Measurements of the cosmic microwave background provide the basis for many of the missing or unmeasured variables present in Friedmann equations that reveal the local geometry of the universe. The cosmic microwave background allows for measurements of the amount of matter and energy in the universe, as well as the rate at which the universe expands.</p>

<p>By applying detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the density of visible matter in the universe may be used in the Friedmann equations. According to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, the density of matter in the universe is near 4.182x10-31 grams per cubic centimeter. This measured density of the universe produces a density parameter between 0.023 and 0.093. Since the range of possible density parameters was definitely less than 1 even with a 5% margin of error of the measurements of the density of the visible matter in the universe, the universe must follow a hyperbolic local geometry according to the measurements of the cosmic microwave background (i.e. the universe must follow an open curved geometry, in which it expands forever and asymptotically approaches a temperature of zero). However, upon examining the total gravitational force exerted in regions of the universe, the gravitational energy did not match the amount of observable matter in the universe. On the contrary, the gravitational energy was approximately 6 times the expected amount. This led to the hypothesis of dark matter, a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. The aforementioned calculation only included the visible matter present in the universe. Since dark matter contributes to the energy density of the universe, it must also be included in the Friedmann equations. After including dark matter, the observable density of the universe is equal to 2.509x10-30 (Wollack). This value, which is approximately 6 times the energy density of the universe when only ordinary matter is included, produces a density parameter between 0.14 and 0.56. Including a 5% margin of error for the measurement of the energy density, the density parameter is still below 1, indicating that the universe is open and curved.</p>

<p>Although measurements of the cosmic microwave background, when applied as part of the Friedmann equations, indicate that the universe follows an open curved local geometry, direct observation of the cosmic microwave background alone indicates that the universe follows a flat Euclidean local geometry within a margin of error of 1%. Due to the nature of the cosmic microwave background, if a telescope collects observations of electromagnetic radiation dating back to when the universe was approximately 100,000 years old, light is no longer visible since the average temperature of the universe was 3,000 degrees Kelvin (the temperature at which a hydrogen atom may split into its component proton and electron) in a plasma form (a plasma is opaque in the presence of radiation). This inevitable opacity preventing direct observations of the initial event of the Big Bang still provides one benefit: it provides a reference point to measure an isosceles Euclidean triangle of known theoretical size. In a open curved universe, one side of the isosceles triangle would appear smaller due to the divergence of light in a hyperbolic curvature. In a closed curved universe, one side of the isosceles triangle would appear larger due to the convergence of light in a spherical curvature. Only a flat universe would produce a triangle appearing equal in dimension to its theoretical size. In the BOOMERanG experiment in Antarctica, a microwave radiometer was lifted above the Earth&#8217;s surface to collect data on the cosmic background, producing images of the fluctuations in temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Each of the fluctuations in the cosmic background ought to be approximately 100,000 light years in width and 14 billion light years in distance away from the earth, which can produce a Euclidean isosceles triangle. By comparing the collected data to computer-generated models of the width of the fluctuations (i.e. the length of one side of the isosceles triangle), scientists were able to observationally determine the curvature of the universe. The data most closely matched computer-generated models of a flat universe (“BOOMERanG”). Further data collection using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe corroborates the data collected from the BOOMERanG experiment as well (United States of America). When compared to the contradicting calculations using the Friedmann equations, the direct observations of the behavior of electromagnetic radiation in space provide greater accuracy and precision; however, the universe cannot be curved and flat simultaneously – one set of measurements must have been incorrect.</p>

<p>Although the measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate with great precision the behavior of light in the universe, the hypothesis that the universe is hyperbolic in its local geometry is further supported by measurements of the rate of expansion of the universe. Measurements of the light emitted by 10 supernovae at different distances indicate that the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating – a characteristic only associated with a hyperbolic local geometry. In a flat universe, the rate of expansion would decelerate over time. The red light shift caused by the expansion of space indicated that the supernovae were between 10% and 15% further away from the Earth than expected if the universe&#8217;s rate of expansion was not accelerating (Riess). Further observations of 42 additional supernovae indicate very similar results: with a 99% level of confidence, the observed geometry of the universe does not account for the observed rate of expansion of the universe (Perlmutter). The total matter in the universe (including dark matter) only accounts for approximately 30% of the necessary energy required to produce a flat universe, presenting an absurd problem: if the universe is flat as observations indicated, what produced the rest of the energy required to make it flat according to the Standard Model of cosmology? With all known matter accounted for mathematically, the universe ought to be hyperbolic in its local geometry. Telescopic data indicated that the rate of the universe&#8217;s expansion continuously accelerates; but in a flat universe that conforms to the Standard Model of cosmology, the rate of the universe&#8217;s expansion would not accelerate – it would decelerate. It seemed that either the mathematically derived components of Einstein&#8217;s Field Equations and the Standard Model of cosmology, which were utilized to assert the existence of the universe with a Euclidean local geometry, were incorrect, or the repetitive collection of data concerning the cosmological red light shift and the total amount of energy in the universe were incorrect. Further processing of the data collected from the light emitted by the supernovae produced an interesting scientific hypothesis: if the additional energy required to produce a flat universe that conforms to observations of the cosmic microwave background was present within empty space itself, it would not only contribute to the energy density of the universe when solving the Friedmann equations, but it would also cause the rate at which space expands to accelerate. Coincidentally, the amount of energy required for the universe to expand 10%-15% faster than expected is equal to the amount of energy missing to produce a density parameter in the Friedmann equations of 1 (i.e. the other 70% of energy required to produce a density parameter of 1). This invisible energy that permeates empty space and accelerates the rate of expansion of space has been termed dark energy (Wollack).</p>

<p>Using the cosmic microwave background alone in conjunction with the assumptions that three things (dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter) form the total energy of the universe, more exact figures may be extrapolated to a greater degree of precision. Measurements indicate that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the universe is flat within a 1% margin of error;</li>
<li>dark energy contributes to 72% of the energy density of the universe;</li>
<li>ordinary matter contributes to 4.6% of the energy density of the universe;</li>
<li>dark matter contributes to 23% of the energy density of the universe;</li>
<li>and seas of fast-moving neutrinos may contribute a minor portion of the energy density of the universe.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The observations collected of the cosmic microwave background and supernovae provide direct observational evidence to support that the universe is flat, but the true mechanisms of dark matter and dark energy are still unknown. In other words, observational evidence supports the hypothesis that the universe follows a flat local geometry, and provides a breakdown of the components of the energy density of the universe that allow it to have a flat local geometry, but does not currently provide insight into the actual properties of dark matter and dark energy. These properties are the subject of current and future investigation in physics, and serve as the primary unexplained point of the investigation into the universe&#8217;s local geometry. Although the properties of 95% of the components of the energy density of the universe are unknown, evidence – both mathematical and observational in nature – supports the hypothesis to the fullest degree possible. The properties of dark matter and dark energy are irrelevant as long as their contribution to the energy density of the universe may be accurately measured. Since the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe has corroborated conclusions from previous experiments like BOOMERanG and the Cosmic Background Explorer while also obtaining data to a significantly greater degree of accuracy, the hypothesis is entirely supported by all current data and accepted models of the universe.</p>

<p>For this investigation, data collected from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, conclusions from the BOOMERanG Experiment, previous calculations of the critical density according to early measurements of the rate of expansion of the universe, observations of supernovae, and the Friedmann equations were used as evidence. Data collected from measurements of the cosmic microwave background is precise and accurate – the density parameter of the universe can be calculated within a 1% margin of error when using the latest processed data. Although the BOOMERanG experiment did not have this level of accuracy, it provides additional verification for the recent measurements collected by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. Prior calculations of the critical density of the universe had very large margins of error due to imprecise measurements of the rate of expansion of the universe. The margin of error was reduced over time by furthering the precision to which the rate of expansion was measured. Observations of supernovae further reinforce the conclusion that the universe follows a flat local geometry, and the validity of the Friedmann equations as a model of the universe is supported by observations of the predominant homogeneity and isotropy of the universe.</p>

<p>Although measurements of the cosmic microwave background are very accurate, there was one element of recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe findings that was not found in previous observations of the cosmic microwave background. The probe found large seas of fast-moving neutrinos present in the universe, and further investigation into these neutrinos may provide greater insight into the properties of the early universe. Similarly, current and future experiments in the with particle accelerators may lead to an understanding of the formation of dark matter and dark energy and the properties of those sources of energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ab-Soul&#8217;s Outro&#8221; from <em>Section 80</em> by Kendrick Lamar is a great example of
what rap music can accomplish.</p>

<p>Jazz has had an influence on rap even before NWA started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A#Influence">sampling jazz tunes in their beats</a>.
Improvisation is a key characteristic of jazz, and it also happens to be a key
part of the creative process for rap music. Unlike conventional poetry, rap
music aims to bend words to create a unique flow like jazz.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Ab-Soul&#8217;s Outro,&#8221; Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul acknowledge that influence by
featuring jazz prominently in the track itself. The producer of the song,
Terrace Martin, is also an excellent saxophonist who is featured throughout the
song and has a solo at the end of the track.</p>

<p>More than anything, these lines keep repeating in my head:</p>

<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s your life about? Enlighten me.
Is you gonna live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gonna plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, child come on.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p> Inspiration is frequently misunderstood. When I was a young writer I looked
 for it in all the wrong places. In my twenties, I lived with my wife in a
 studio apartment just off Washington Square. Somehow I decided that the best
 writing time for me was late at night–I guessed that was when the muses
 would be running wild and delivering intoxicating poetic secrets. Perhaps I
 got this impression from Thelonious Monk’s ‘Round about Midnight” which I
 played over and over–it was so hauntingly beautiful and sad. In those days,
 after a late heavy dinner with a couple of beers topped off by more than a
 few drags of weed, I took my yellow legal pad into the chilly unsightly
 stairwell across from my front door and got ready to write the great
 American novel. Ugh, wrong move, Waitz. I recall sitting in the stairwell
 waiting for inspiration to strike until I was dozing off or feeling too
 cold. Some evenings when my wife was off taking classes at N.Y.U., for
 inspiration I maxed out the hifi with Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane
 blasting pure madness solos while I tried to compose my delicate pages.
 Wrong. Wrong. All wrong, Waitzkin.</p>

<p> Now, many years later, when I’m working on a book I write everyday except
 Sunday, when I watch football or go to the country with my wife. This routine
 has settled deeply inside. It gives me confidence. I’ve learned that pages
 will come if I go to my quiet office and stick with my routine. Back in the
 younger days, the unsightly stairwell seemed cool, but not now. I could never
 do my best work after a heavy meal or with the music blasting. It would be a
 distraction–an energy robber.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/03/24/the-alchemy-of-writing-tips-from-a-non-fiction-and-fiction-pro/">an interview between Tim Ferris and Fred Waitzkin</a>
with Waitzkin discussing inspiration.</p>

<p>Inspiration is often seen as a kind of &#8220;eureka moment&#8221; where great ideas
suddenly materialize. We view inspiration as an instantaneous event.
Inspiration either happens, or it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>The examples are everywhere. If you look at Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook was not
his only success. Facebook was a culmination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg#Software_developer">years of software development</a>
throughout his teens. He didn&#8217;t randomly realize the power of the Internet and
then decide to build a social network. He spent years on the Internet before
realizing its potential uses. He spent years programming before building
something great.</p>

<p>If you dislike anecdotal evidence (for good reasons!), there is <em>empirical
evidence</em> to support this claim. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#Behavior">Conscientousness has positive effects on life outcomes</a>
according to a variety of different measurements. The desire for excellence and
a willingness to do hard work is a key factor in determining success.</p>

<p>Effectively, our intuitive notions of inspiration may just be a byproduct of
our inability to consciously trace the origins of our best ideas. Instead of
attempting to replicate the actions that led us to good ideas, we are caught in
trying to replicate the <em>situations</em> that led us to good ideas. This is
reflected by the fundamental attribution error: when we see other people&#8217;s
successes, we associate the results with a property of the people themselves, but when we
see our own successes, we associate the results with the situation we are in.</p>

<p>The hardest part of creative work is <em>starting</em> and <em>continuing</em> the work.
&#8220;Inspiration&#8221; is the easy part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed an <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment.html#comment-478842490">excellent comment on Marissa Mayer&#8217;s blog</a>
about the nature of burnout.</p>

<blockquote><p>Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or
effort into high-risk problems that fail.  It&#8217;s the result of a negative
prediction error in the nucleus accumbens.  You effectively condition your
brain to associate work with failure.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, then eventually, consciously, you wonder if it&#8217;s worth it.
The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing
small things that you know are going to work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many times, burnout is attributed to working too hard. Though this is certainly
a cause, it is important to understand that the burnout is more likely to occur
if the work isn&#8217;t <em>rewarded</em> in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>This is the reason why people are willing to sink hundreds of hours into video
games doing seemingly boring tasks like mining for gold. The behavior gets
rewarded within the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules">according to a schedule</a>
that optimizes for addiction. The banality of the task is offset by the
instantaneous rewards provided by the system.</p>

<p>As described in the comment, the key to avoiding burnout is not necessarily
just to reduce workload. The key to avoiding burnout appears to be the use of
small guaranteed successes as a way to offset the cognitive impact of large
failures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier&#8217;s Blog</a> is an ecellent web site to
read, especially if you are interested in issues related to security. Although
a lot of his writing can be very technical, there are a few of his essays that
make complex ideas easier to understand. One of my favorite posts from his blog
is <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/security_vs_pri.html">Security vs. Privacy</a>, an
analysis of the false dilemma that is often constructed between national
security and individual privacy.</p>

<p>Not all security measures need to violate privacy, and not all violations of
privacy lead to increased levels of security. An attempt to frame security and
privacy as two opposing forces is misinformed at its best and pernicious at its
worst.</p>

<p>To put it a step further, invasions of privacy are often attempts to profile
people. By establishing patterns that describe a <em>typical terrorist</em>, we can
narrow our searches and focus on people who actually exhibit behavior that
resembles known terrorists. The standard argument is, &#8220;if you have nothing to
hide, why should you care?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although privacy is important for its own sake, using personal information like
Internet usage or private emails to find suspected terrorists is <em>not a very
good idea</em>. A person with the desire to execute a complex terror plot will
probably not send vital information over an unencrypted channel. Unless the
NSA can outsmart <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>,
the invasions of privacy will only foil terror plots conducted by
unsophisticated groups. The benefits associated with sacrifices of privacy
would be marginal at best. The end result will be an ocean of information
available to government agencies about
ordinary people without the knowledge to protect themselves.</p>

<p>This is the same reason why pilots have to go through airport security. Even
though a pilot can crash the plane, the security concern is not about the
potential damage a pilot can cause. The security concern is about whether the
pilot <em>is actually a pilot</em>. When designing a security system, the security of
the whole system is only as good as the weakest link. If pilots don&#8217;t have to go
through ordinary security lines, a terrorist would only need a pilot&#8217;s uniform
and badge to go through security undetected.</p>

<p>Likewise, if we use people&#8217;s private information, whether it&#8217;s emails or Facebook
activity, we should be careful not to create a tiered security system. If a
potential terrorist only needs to act normal on Facebook in order to avoid
the government&#8217;s attention, monitoring Facebook accounts will not actually
provide more security.</p>

<p>Security is always a matter of cost and benefit, but privacy is rarely an
effective price to pay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m two weeks into the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Stanford Machine Learning course</a>
taught by Andrew Ng through Coursera.</p>

<p>The class is excellent, and I&#8217;m having a great time going through the material.
Coursera&#8217;s platform not only makes it really easy to watch the lectures, but
the material in the course is taught really well.</p>

<p>Overall, the experience has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p>There are two types of assignments in the class: lecture review questions and
programming exercises. The lecture review questions are multiple choice
questions you complete online, and the programming exercises are
automatically-graded code exercises that focus on Octave.</p>

<p>So far, the material has been relatively simple, and the course has only
covered a brief introduction to the topic of Machine Learning as well as linear
regression with a single or multiple variables. The Octave programming language
has also been introduced, but the course is still progressing quite well.</p>

<p>The high quality of the course and the amazing price tag (free!) seem to be
signalling pretty big changes in education coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://personalmba.com/">The Personal MBA</a> by Josh Kaufman is probably one of
the best business books I&#8217;ve read. I usually don&#8217;t enjoy reading business
books, but Kaufman does an excellent job of being precise and concise in his
explanations of terminology and strategy.</p>

<p>In short, a business is a repeatable process that:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>creates or provides something of value that</li>
<li>other people want or need</li>
<li>at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that</li>
<li>satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and</li>
<li>provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As Kaufman says, everything else is a hobby.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://sivers.org/book/PersonalMBA">Derek Sivers&#8217; review</a> of the book
is a very good summary, the book itself is a must-read for anyone who wants to
start a business.</p>

<p>A few key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test everything. Any assumption that is untested should be questioned unless
there is external evidence (e.g. science) that validates the assumption.</li>
<li>Business is all about creating value and extracting a portion of the value
that is created.</li>
<li>There are two things your business does: things that provide value and waste.</li>
<li>We are inherently biased towards the things we create. External validation is
crucial.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t delay a launch in search of perfection, but iterate towards it over
time.</li>
<li>Measure the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring a customer
through different channels. Once these variables are measured, and the cost
of acquiring a customer is less than the lifetime value, profits will be easy
to increase.</li>
<li>Test prices. Higher prices are usually not as bad as you may think.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most valuable things I have ever read is the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> sequence
<a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">How To Actually Change Your Mind</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend it without hesitation to anyone who hasn&#8217;t already read it.</p>

<p>Here are some gems:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you see people insisting that no amount of money whatsoever is worth a
single human life, and then driving an extra mile to save $10; or when you
see people insisting that no amount of money is worth a decrement of health,
and then choosing the cheapest health insurance available; then you don&#8217;t
think that their protestations reveal some deep truth about incommensurable
utilities.</p>

<p>In the West, there is a saying: &#8220;The squaky wheel gets the grease.&#8221; In Japan,
the corresponding saying runs: &#8220;The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe there was a lawsuit where someone alleged that the draft lottery
was unfair, because the slips with names on them were not being mixed
thoroughly enough; and the judge replied, &#8220;To whom is it unfair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we cannot learn to take joy in the merely real, our lives will be empty
indeed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire sequence is very long, but also worth reading through. It is the
kind of thing that changes the way you think, and it includes numerous
interesting footnotes and citations that provide an endless rabbit hole of
thought-provoking content.</p>
