    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://personalmba.com/">The Personal MBA</a> by Josh Kaufman is probably one of
the best business books I've read. I usually don't enjoy reading business
books, but Kaufman does an excellent job of being precise and concise in his
explanations of terminology and strategy.</p>

<p>In short, a business is a repeatable process that:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>creates or provides something of value that</li>
<li>other people want or need</li>
<li>at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that</li>
<li>satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and</li>
<li>provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As Kaufman says, everything else is a hobby.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://sivers.org/book/PersonalMBA">Derek Sivers' review</a> of the book
is a very good summary, the book itself is a must-read for anyone who wants to
start a business.</p>

<p>A few key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test everything. Any assumption that is untested should be questioned unless
there is external evidence (e.g. science) that validates the assumption.</li>
<li>Business is all about creating value and extracting a portion of the value
that is created.</li>
<li>There are two things your business does: things that provide value and waste.</li>
<li>We are inherently biased towards the things we create. External validation is
crucial.</li>
<li>Don't delay a launch in search of perfection, but iterate towards it over
time.</li>
<li>Measure the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring a customer
through different channels. Once these variables are measured, and the cost
of acquiring a customer is less than the lifetime value, profits will be easy
to increase.</li>
<li>Test prices. Higher prices are usually not as bad as you may think.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/05/04/how-to-actually-change-your-mind/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-04T23:03:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/05/04/how-to-actually-change-your-mind</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most valuable things I have ever read is the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> sequence
<a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">How To Actually Change Your Mind</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend it without hesitation to anyone who hasn't already read it.</p>

<p>Here are some gems:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you see people insisting that no amount of money whatsoever is worth a
single human life, and then driving an extra mile to save $10; or when you
see people insisting that no amount of money is worth a decrement of health,
and then choosing the cheapest health insurance available; then you don't
think that their protestations reveal some deep truth about incommensurable
utilities.</p>

<p>In the West, there is a saying: "The squaky wheel gets the grease." In Japan,
the corresponding saying runs: "The nail that sticks up gets hammered down."</p>

<p>I believe there was a lawsuit where someone alleged that the draft lottery
was unfair, because the slips with names on them were not being mixed
thoroughly enough; and the judge replied, "To whom is it unfair?"</p>

<p>"If we cannot learn to take joy in the merely real, our lives will be empty
indeed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire sequence is very long, but also worth reading through. It is the
kind of thing that changes the way you think, and it includes numerous
interesting footnotes and citations that provide an endless rabbit hole of
thought-provoking content.</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/05/01/books-im-reading</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some books that I'm reading right now, and they're all fantastic.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert - this is a science fiction book involving
intergalactic politics and complicated plots</li>
<li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman - this is a nonfiction book
written by a Nobel Prize winner in economics about how we make sense of
information and form conclusions</li>
<li><em>Titan</em> by Ron Chernow - this is a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. that
is unfortunately dry at times, but has some great stories</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm trying to get in the habit of reviewing books, so this is my way of holding
myself accountable: I'll post reviews by the end of May.</p>

    <link href="http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/11/the-attraction-of-fan-fiction/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T21:12:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/11/the-attraction-of-fan-fiction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished re-reading all of Eliezer Yudkowsky's Harry Potter fanfic -
<a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>. After reading
it again, I have a new appreciation for what Eliezer is attempting.</p>

<p>Writing fan fiction based on a series as popular as Harry Potter allows Eliezer
to construct a new world from existing parts. Instead of having to spend
enormous amounts of time establishing the histories and personalities of his
characters, he can focus only on the parts that are <em>different</em> from the
original work. It is through these differences that Eliezer is able to explain
seemingly-complex concepts involving Bayesian Rationality, quantum mechanics,
cognitive biases, and psychology.</p>

<p>The references to science seem forced at times, but the underlying story is
gripping in a way that is very different from J.K. Rowling's writing. Eliezer
has elevated the art of fan fiction to a different level - instead of just
constructing a story that extends the original, he constructs a story that
transcends it.</p>

<p>Give it a shot. It's worth reading.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Some Quotes from Musashi]]></title>
    <link href="http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/10/some-quotes-from-musashi/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-10T23:19:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/10/some-quotes-from-musashi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished re-reading <em>Musashi</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa. It is possibly my
favorite book, and I will write a more comprehensive book review another time.
For now, I just wanted to share a few quotes that I thought were golden.</p>

<p>If you are striving to improve yourself to a point of perfection, read
<em>Musashi</em>. If you are interested in martial arts, read <em>Musashi</em>. If you enjoy
reading books, read <em>Musashi</em>. It is a gripping story that is written with wit
and wisdom.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ah, even I'm beginning to think priests are crazy. Everywhere they go, they
meet no one but people rushing toward hell."</p>

<p>I am not so distant from the gods and the universe. I can touch them with the
three-foot sword I carry. But not so long as I feel there is a distinction
between nature and humankind. Not so long as I remain distant from the realm
of the true expert, the fully developed man."</p>

<p>You seem to be under the misconception that if you perform one brave deed,
that alone makes you a samurai. Well it doesn't! you let that one act of
loyalty convince you of your righteousness. The more convinced you became,
the more harm you caused yourself and everyone else.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Musashi's own (non-fiction) <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories were
not due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural ability, or
the order of heaven, or that other schools' strategy was inferior. After that
I studied morning and evening searching for the principle, and came to
realise the Way of strategy when I was fifty. Since then I have lived without
following any particular Way. Thus with the virtue of strategy I practise
many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher. To write this book I
did not use the law of Buddha or the teachings of Confucius, neither old war
chronicles nor books on martial tactics. I take up my brush to explain the
true spirit of this Ichi school as it is mirrored in the Way of heaven and
Kwannon. The time is the night of the tenth day of the tenth month, at the
hour of the tiger.</p></blockquote>

<p>I still feel like I haven't encapsulated the essence of it all. I'll try again
tomorrow...</p>
