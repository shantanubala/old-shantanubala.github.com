The following is the conclusion of [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/neuroscience-under-attack.html?hpw&_r=0) from the New York Times.

> It’s not hard to understand why neuroscience is so appealing. We all seek shortcuts to enlightenment. It’s reassuring to believe that brain images and machine analysis will reveal the fundamental truth about our minds and their contents. But as the neuro doubters make plain, we may be asking too much of neuroscience, expecting that its explanations will be definitive. Yet it’s hard to imagine that any functional magnetic resonance imaging or chemical map will ever explain “The Golden Bowl” or heaven. Or that brain imaging, no matter how sophisticated and precise, will ever tell us what women really want.

The golden rule of a shoddy argument: too many qualifiers.

Aside from the way the discussion is framed, the article also fails to point out a simple fact: [neuroplasticity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity). When you find out that Republicans have different brain chemsitry than Democrats, your assumption shouldn't automatically be that they were *born that way*. Our brain "rewires" itself according to the stimuli it receives. That's what makes the brain powerful from the start.

The discussion starts and ends with one sentence: correlation is not causation.
