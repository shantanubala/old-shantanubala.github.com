    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working on my ability to remember information. Instead of using memory
&#8220;tricks&#8221; like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_%28psychology%29">chunking</a>, I&#8217;m
working on simply using a &#8220;brute force&#8221; approach to storing information in
long term memory using flash cards.</p>

<p>Although this isn&#8217;t the most efficient way to remember information, it&#8217;s the
best way to remember information <em>unintentionally</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with the method of loci and chunking is simple: those techniques
only provide you with access to information within the context of the
technique. The method of loci makes memorizing information very easy, but you
need to focus on visualizing a spatial location to access your memories.
Chunking groups small pieces of information into larger parts, but what if you
need an individual piece at a random time?</p>

<p>The problem with a lot of memory techniques is that they don&#8217;t address the main
issue with memory: when is it useful to know the information? Chunking and the
method of loci are useful for memorizing a speech or for situations when you
know in advance that you will need a piece of information.</p>

<p>What if I need information, but I can&#8217;t predict when or how that need will
arise?</p>

<p>The best way, in that situation, is to create as many associations with
related things as possible. As a result, I&#8217;m giving a few different flash card
tools a try. With these tools, I&#8217;m attempting to memorize maps of the world,
vocabulary words, historical events, and animal species. To make the process as
effective as possible, I&#8217;m working on creating a set of images from Flickr
corresponding to each of the words, and the flash cards will have multiple
&#8220;definitions&#8221; that can point to a single word.</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve enjoyed using the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> - a downloadable tool that tracks the intervals
between correct and incorrect recall to maximize the probability of
successfully storing a flash card in long term memory</li>
<li><a href="http://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> - a web-based social tool with thousands of
existing sets of flash cards that are ripe for memorizing and learning</li>
<li><a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> - a newer and sleeker web-based tool with
fewer flash cards available to study, but incorporates gamification and
tracking of accuracy to maximize recall</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some books that I&#8217;m reading right now, and they&#8217;re all fantastic.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert - this is a science fiction book involving
intergalactic politics and complicated plots</li>
<li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman - this is a nonfiction book
written by a Nobel Prize winner in economics about how we make sense of
information and form conclusions</li>
<li><em>Titan</em> by Ron Chernow - this is a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. that
is unfortunately dry at times, but has some great stories</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to get in the habit of reviewing books, so this is my way of holding
myself accountable: I&#8217;ll post reviews by the end of May.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Salman Rushdie is an amazing author. His books produce magic in ways that I
can&#8217;t explain in a blog post.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed this talk:</p>

<p>And I particularly enjoy this quote from <em>Midnight&#8217;s Children</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before
me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone
everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am
anything that happens after I&#8217;ve gone which would not have happened if I had
not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each &#8220;I,&#8221; every
one of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude.
I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you&#8217;ll have to swallow a world.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The specific project I was evaluating had only gotten $800,000 out of the
maximum $2m. Its strategy was to purchase the male students iPod Touches, the
female students makeovers, manicures, and pedicures at a local beauty parlor,
and all students were offered an additional iPod Touch or Makeover,
respectively, if they passed the exam at the end of the current year. The
grant proposal had specifically listed these actions as being the goal of the
proposal. If the iPods and makeovers were purchased, that constituted
success.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was from a LessWrong article about the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/h5z/problems_in_education/">problems with education</a>.</p>

<p>Although this article outlines the problems with the way funds are distributed
to our schools through grants, it is a problem with human nature.</p>

<p>Once we create a solution to a problem, we judge the success of our endeavours
by the success with which we execute our solution instead of judging based on
the <em>metrics that define the problem</em>.</p>

<p>The short answer: measure everything, and evaluate results based on the
evidence.</p>

    <link href="http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/11/the-attraction-of-fan-fiction/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T21:12:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/11/the-attraction-of-fan-fiction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished re-reading all of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#8217;s Harry Potter fanfic -
<a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>. After reading
it again, I have a new appreciation for what Eliezer is attempting.</p>

<p>Writing fan fiction based on a series as popular as Harry Potter allows Eliezer
to construct a new world from existing parts. Instead of having to spend
enormous amounts of time establishing the histories and personalities of his
characters, he can focus only on the parts that are <em>different</em> from the
original work. It is through these differences that Eliezer is able to explain
seemingly-complex concepts involving Bayesian Rationality, quantum mechanics,
cognitive biases, and psychology.</p>

<p>The references to science seem forced at times, but the underlying story is
gripping in a way that is very different from J.K. Rowling&#8217;s writing. Eliezer
has elevated the art of fan fiction to a different level - instead of just
constructing a story that extends the original, he constructs a story that
transcends it.</p>

<p>Give it a shot. It&#8217;s worth reading.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-10T23:19:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/10/some-quotes-from-musashi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished re-reading <em>Musashi</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa. It is possibly my
favorite book, and I will write a more comprehensive book review another time.
For now, I just wanted to share a few quotes that I thought were golden.</p>

<p>If you are striving to improve yourself to a point of perfection, read
<em>Musashi</em>. If you are interested in martial arts, read <em>Musashi</em>. If you enjoy
reading books, read <em>Musashi</em>. It is a gripping story that is written with wit
and wisdom.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ah, even I&#8217;m beginning to think priests are crazy. Everywhere they go, they
meet no one but people rushing toward hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not so distant from the gods and the universe. I can touch them with the
three-foot sword I carry. But not so long as I feel there is a distinction
between nature and humankind. Not so long as I remain distant from the realm
of the true expert, the fully developed man.&#8221;</p>

<p>You seem to be under the misconception that if you perform one brave deed,
that alone makes you a samurai. Well it doesn&#8217;t! you let that one act of
loyalty convince you of your righteousness. The more convinced you became,
the more harm you caused yourself and everyone else.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Musashi&#8217;s own (non-fiction) <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories were
not due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural ability, or
the order of heaven, or that other schools&#8217; strategy was inferior. After that
I studied morning and evening searching for the principle, and came to
realise the Way of strategy when I was fifty. Since then I have lived without
following any particular Way. Thus with the virtue of strategy I practise
many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher. To write this book I
did not use the law of Buddha or the teachings of Confucius, neither old war
chronicles nor books on martial tactics. I take up my brush to explain the
true spirit of this Ichi school as it is mirrored in the Way of heaven and
Kwannon. The time is the night of the tenth day of the tenth month, at the
hour of the tiger.</p></blockquote>

<p>I still feel like I haven&#8217;t encapsulated the essence of it all. I&#8217;ll try again
tomorrow&#8230;</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/09/the-ancient-world-podcast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just recently stubmled across <a href="http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/">The Ancient World</a>,
a podcast about ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to really enjoy learning about history through audio, and this
podcast brilliantly describes Ancient Mesopotamia really well, and it is still
being updated with new episodes!</p>

<p>There are two (no longer updated) podcasts that are still worth listening to:
<a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh">Hardcore History</a> and
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome</a>.</p>

<p>Learning about history can be fascinating for a simple (and trite) reason: past
events often resemble our present predicaments.</p>

<p>One such example is the life of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a>,
a general in Rome over 2,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Sulla was one of the first to break the rules of the constitution of the Roman
Republic in an effort to <em>preserve the values of the constitution</em>.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/08/moonwalking-with-einstein</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> by Joshua Foer is an excellent book. Although you
can watch his TED talk to get a quick summary of the book&#8217;s main ideas, I would
highly recommend reading the book.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://shan.tanu.me//www.youtube.com/embed/U6PoUg7jXsA"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The book details his journey from being an ordinary journalist to a memory
champion - he went from having average memory to being able to memorize
thousand-digit numbers with ease. The most startling part of the entire book:
anyone can perform the same tricks with an average memory.</p>

<p>The memory techniques definitely seem like <em>tricks</em>, but they are very
effective, and date back to Cicero&#8217;s speeches in the Roman Senate.</p>

<p>Although the specific techniques, like using spatial memory to remember
different details, are interesting, there is another profound aspect to the
book that cannot be overstated: simply because something appears to be
extraordinary does not mean you have to be extraordinary to do it. At first
glance, the ability to memorize thousands of random digits seems like it would
require <em>genius</em>, when it truly just requires focus and practice.</p>

<p>If there is one important lesson to gain from the book, it is that focus and
deliberate practice can produce seemingly superhuman results.</p>

    <link href="http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/07/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-07T09:02:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/07/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr. Feynman</em> by Richard Feynman is one of the best
autobiographical books I have ever read. The brilliance of the book is its
seeming lack of structure - Feynman simply jumps between different stories
about his life, but the end result is fascinating. Richard Feynman is possibly
one of the most interesting people to have lived, and this book is good
evidence for that.</p>

<blockquote><p>The electron is a theory we use; it is so useful in understanding the way
nature works that we can almost call it real.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are gems hidden in the book like the above quote. It seems like an
ordinary statement, but hidden inside of it is something really profound:
Feynman is able to put very complex ideas into simple words. He is describing
the difference between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Map_and_the_Territory">map and the territory</a>
without invoking age-old philosophical discussions. Instead, he uses a
semicolon.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I
wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It&#8217;s
difficult to describe because it&#8217;s an emotion. It&#8217;s analogous to the feeling
one has in religion that has to do with a god that controls everything in the
whole universe: there&#8217;s a generality aspect that you feel when you think
about how things that appear so different and behave so differently are all
run &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; by the same organization, the same physical laws.
It&#8217;s an appreciation of the mathematical beauty of nature, of how she works
inside; a realization that the phenomena we see result from the complexity of
the inner workings between atoms; a feeling of how dramatic and wonderful it
is. It&#8217;s a feeling of awe — of scientific awe — which I felt could be
communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had this emotion. It
could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the
universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Behind Feynman&#8217;s life is a desire to discover the world and bottle it within
his mind. It appears that the book isn&#8217;t just intended as a way to store his
memories. Instead, he closes the novel with a speech he wrote encouraging
students to find environments in which their curiosity can flourish.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most exciting things about Facebook Home is that Facebook is
releasing a phone in partnership with HTC.</p>

<p>Although I don’t personally use a smart phone, it is fascinating to think about
the change this could bring.</p>

<p>SMS used to be a big deal before the iPhone. It’s only very recently that
social networking has taken over communication, although SMS is still used for
communication that needs to be instant.</p>

<p>The key question for the future: how much will the lines between phone calls,
SMS, and Facebook messaging blur? How long will it take before Facebook
establishes itself as an identity on the same level as a phone number?</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2013/04/03/a-tutorial-on-negotiation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Planet Money is an excellent podcast, and there was an episode a few months ago when <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/21/167802325/episode-425-an-fbi-hostage-negotiator-buys-a-car">a hostage negotiator bought a car</a>.</p>

<p>Negotiation is an interesting game of psychology. The episode outlines
different kinds of tactics, like asking for multiple small things individually
to slowly tip the negotiation in your favor. Another tactic was to increase the
&#8220;size of the pie&#8221; by negotiating for things that have more value to you than
the person you are negotiating with.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://shan.tanu.me//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S0qjK3TWZE8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The above scenario is a little different, but involves similar concepts. It&#8217;s a
variation on the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma. The video is worth a watch, and has
spurred some <a href="http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/index.php/economics/comments/game-show-game-theory">fascinating economic analysis</a>.</p>

<p>In the above variation of the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, two participants are forced
to choose (without knowing the other person&#8217;s choice) to either split a prize
or steal it. If they both choose to split, they both receive half of the prize.
If one chooses to steal while the other chooses to split, the person who steals
receives the full quantity of the prize. If they both choose to steal, they
lose the entire prize.</p>

<p>The participant in the video changed the rules of the game: instead of playing
the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, he bent the rules and removed the &#8220;dilemma&#8221; for the
other player.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the best way to negotiate is to step outside of the ordinary
interpretation of the way <em>things are supposed to be</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to write a post yesterday.</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>

<p>I wanted to get in the habit of writing <em>something</em>, even if it was a crappy
sentence or two, or a repost of something I found online, or a quote of
something trite. Instead, I posted nothing yesterday.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s tricky. How do I motivate myself to write everyday? How should I do it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try the following, and see what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>write every day <em>immediately after breakfast</em></li>
<li>set a small goal of 5 sentences</li>
<li>write about anything, even something as trivial as how I feel or what I ate
for breakfast</li>
<li>write until ideas stop flowing</li>
<li>publish immediately, and edit later during the day when I&#8217;m bored</li>
</ul>


<p>Before, I simply had a perpetual &#8220;todo&#8221; with &#8220;write a blogpost,&#8221; and I would
find ways to procrastinate. Hopefully I can hold myself to higher
accountability!</p>

positive psychology. Positive psychology is all about using behavior as a way
to produce positive changes in mood. It&#8217;s the opposite of learned helplessness:
learned optimism.</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/flourish">his speech at the RSA</a>, and
started doing a simple daily exercise he recommends: writing down 3 good things that
happened during the day and why they happened.</p>

<p>That simple exercise has produced lower levels of depression and higher levels
of psychological well-being in placebo-controlled studies. It&#8217;s so simple that
it almost feels a little silly while doing it, but I recommend trying it out.
It quickly becomes engaging, and it is really interesting to go back in time
and smile at the things that made me happy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to start doing time tracking for years, but I could never pick up
the habit. It was always really difficult to keep things organized. I didn&#8217;t
ever want to spend money on a tool that I would stop using, and I didn&#8217;t like
using Excel, handwritten notes, or a text file.</p>

<p>I started using Google Forms when it came out, and I can say now with
confidence that it is one of the best ways to do time tracking because it
allows you to customize the fields to your liking. I track how much sleep I
get, how many hours I spend on work, how many books I read, and many other
variables. It can go beyond time tracking: I even use it as a tool for
journaling.</p>

<p>All I do is have an email reminder sent to my inbox every day with a link to
the form I created. Since the form is linked to a spreadsheet, Google gives
instant visualizations of data, including bar charts, pie charts, and other
simple graphics that keep me motivated.</p>

<p>Sometimes, really simple general purpose tools can be really effective with the
right customizations. I&#8217;d recommend taking a look at the &#8220;Forms&#8221; feature of
<a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Emilien Ghomi from the Université Paris-Sud received a <em>best paper</em> award at
the 2012 ACM CHI (Human-Computer Interaction) conference last year for a paper
describing the effectiveness of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Using+Rhythmic+Patterns+as+an+Input+Method&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Ghomi">using rhythmic patterns as an input method</a>.</p>

<p>The motiation for the research was simple: rhythm is a natural part of life.
Recognizing and reproducing rhythms is considered a fundamental human ability,
by psychologists, and it could prove to be an effective input method in a
computer interface. Games are an excellent example of using rhythm as input,
especially when the games are music-related (e.g. Guitar Hero). Physiological
psychologists have determined that humans have an innate sense of rhythm, and
in Human-Computer Interaction, existing interfaces use timing to distinguish
between different types of user behaviors (e.g. a double click on a mouse).</p>

<p>The primary advantage of rhythmic input involve its simplicity: unlike
gestures, rhythmic input requires very little space and can be detected very
accurately.</p>

<p>The researchers conducted two experiments, the first of which involved 12
participants (5 of whom never had any experience playing music) who were
instructed to repeat rhythmic patterns on the touchpad of a 13-inch MacBook
that were displayed to them using a static graphic, visual animation, and audio
representation. Additionally, participants were given different types of
feedback to facilitate learning. The overall success rate was 64.3%, but the
researchers note that the recognizer used in the experiment was very strict. In
practice, a much higher accuracy rate could be obtained by reducing the
vocabulary of rhythms and increasing the margin of error for allowed input. A
second experiment testing the recall rate of rhythms associated with
different commands resulted in an initial recall rate of 74%, but an improved
recall rate of 93% in a later test.</p>

<p>The most interesting applications of rhythmic input seem to be in mobile
devices, like smartphones and tablets with built-in touchscreens. So far,
gestures have been the primary input method (swipe, pinch, etc.), but rhythms
may be an effective method of user input in situations where a person is not
looking directly at the screen or the touchscreen itself is obscured (the
rhythms may be captured using an accelerometer).</p>

<p>The medium used for expression has an effect on the nature of the expression
itself. Like a dream, any creative work is simultaneously created and perceived
at the same time with each preceding brush stroke, word, or step influencing
the direction of the next.</p>

<p>When you experience something created by another person, you are transported
into their reality, a world governed by their rules.
Ultimately, these worlds on their own have no use or purpose, but even reality
has no intrinsic use or purpose. The true significance is their effects on us.</p>

<p>Even though you understand yourself through your thoughts, reality understands
you through actions. It is your choice to walk away from a spinning top.</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2012/11/25/the-war-on-men-was-an-inside-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/">this article</a> on Fox News.</p>

<blockquote><p>As the author of three books on the American family and its intersection with pop culture, I’ve spent thirteen years examining social agendas as they pertain to sex, parenting, and gender roles. During this time, I’ve spoken with hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women. And in doing so, I’ve accidentally stumbled upon a subculture of men who’ve told me, in no uncertain terms, that they’re never getting married. When I ask them why, the answer is always the same.</p>

<p>Women aren’t women anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>How do they know so confidently that &#8220;women aren&#8217;t women anymore&#8221; if they&#8217;ve never been married? Actually, the word &#8220;never&#8221; is important: this demographic of men is probably too young to even remember what women <em>were</em> to begin with. If a man is well over 40, <em>never</em> getting married will be discussed in the <em>past tense</em>, and it&#8217;s only these men who have any right to say something about what women were like in a previous generation. If a person was not alive, how would they know what women <em>were</em> like?</p>

<p>The alternate explanation: this has nothing to do with the current generation of women, and everything to do with the men she&#8217;s interviewing. &#8220;Women aren&#8217;t women anymore&#8221; just requires less self-analysis and an unbruised ego.</p>

    <id>http://shan.tanu.me/blog/2012/11/24/neuroscience-not-under-attack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following is the conclusion of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/neuroscience-under-attack.html?hpw&amp;_r=0">this article</a> from the New York Times.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s not hard to understand why neuroscience is so appealing. We all seek shortcuts to enlightenment. It’s reassuring to believe that brain images and machine analysis will reveal the fundamental truth about our minds and their contents. But as the neuro doubters make plain, we may be asking too much of neuroscience, expecting that its explanations will be definitive. Yet it’s hard to imagine that any functional magnetic resonance imaging or chemical map will ever explain “The Golden Bowl” or heaven. Or that brain imaging, no matter how sophisticated and precise, will ever tell us what women really want.</p></blockquote>

<p>The golden rule of a shoddy argument: too many qualifiers.</p>

<p>Aside from the way the discussion is framed, the article also fails to point out a simple fact: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a>. When you find out that Republicans have different brain chemsitry than Democrats, your assumption shouldn&#8217;t automatically be that they were <em>born that way</em>. Our brain &#8220;rewires&#8221; itself according to the stimuli it receives. That&#8217;s what makes the brain powerful from the start.</p>

<p>The discussion starts and ends with one sentence: correlation is not causation.</p>
