*Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman* by Richard Feynman is one of the best
autobiographical books I have ever read. The brilliance of the book is its
seeming lack of structure - Feynman simply jumps between different stories
about his life, but the end result is fascinating. Richard Feynman is possibly
one of the most interesting people to have lived, and this book is good
evidence for that.

There are gems hidden in the book like the above quote. It seems like an
ordinary statement, but hidden inside of it is something really profound:
Feynman is able to put very complex ideas into simple words. He is describing
the difference between the [map and the territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Map_and_the_Territory)
without invoking age-old philosophical discussions. Instead, he uses a
semicolon.

Behind Feynman's life is a desire to discover the world and bottle it within
his mind. It appears that the book isn't just intended as a way to store his
memories. Instead, he closes the novel with a speech he wrote encouraging
students to find environments in which their curiosity can flourish.
