I forgot to write a post yesterday.

This is bad.

I wanted to get in the habit of writing *something*, even if it was a crappy
sentence or two, or a repost of something I found online, or a quote of
something trite. Instead, I posted nothing yesterday.

It's tricky. How do I motivate myself to write everyday? How should I do it?

I'm going to try the following, and see what happens:

- write every day *immediately after breakfast*
- set a small goal of 5 sentences
- write about anything, even something as trivial as how I feel or what I ate
  for breakfast
- write until ideas stop flowing
- publish immediately, and edit later during the day when I'm bored

Before, I simply had a perpetual "todo" with "write a blogpost," and I would
find ways to procrastinate. Hopefully I can hold myself to higher
accountability!
