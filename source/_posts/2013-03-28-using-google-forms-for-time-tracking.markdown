I've wanted to start doing time tracking for years, but I could never pick up
the habit. It was always really difficult to keep things organized. I didn't
ever want to spend money on a tool that I would stop using, and I didn't like
using Excel, handwritten notes, or a text file.

I started using Google Forms when it came out, and I can say now with
confidence that it is one of the best ways to do time tracking because it
allows you to customize the fields to your liking. I track how much sleep I
get, how many hours I spend on work, how many books I read, and many other
variables. It can go beyond time tracking: I even use it as a tool for
journaling.

All I do is have an email reminder sent to my inbox every day with a link to
the form I created. Since the form is linked to a spreadsheet, Google gives
instant visualizations of data, including bar charts, pie charts, and other
simple graphics that keep me motivated.

Sometimes, really simple general purpose tools can be really effective with the
right customizations. I'd recommend taking a look at the "Forms" feature of
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
