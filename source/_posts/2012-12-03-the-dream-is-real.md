![the spinning top in Inception](/images/inception-top.png "Inception")

The medium used for expression has an effect on the nature of the expression
itself. Like a dream, any creative work is simultaneously created and perceived
at the same time with each preceding brush stroke, word, or step influencing
the direction of the next.

When you experience something created by another person, you are transported
into their reality, a world governed by their rules.
Ultimately, these worlds on their own have no use or purpose, but even reality
has no intrinsic use or purpose. The true significance is their effects on us.

Even though you understand yourself through your thoughts, reality understands
you through actions. It is your choice to walk away from a spinning top.
