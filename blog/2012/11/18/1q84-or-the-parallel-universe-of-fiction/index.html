<div class="entry-content"><p>I first became cursed with a mild obsession with Haruki Murakami after reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, a novel that slowly and progressively redefined reality within the boundaries of its plot. I&#8217;m not new to magical realism, and I consider <em>Midnight&#8217;s Children</em> and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> to be among my favorite books, but my appreciation for Murakami&#8217;s novels stems from an aspect of his writing that differs slightly from Rushdie or Marquez. With <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, I spent a majority of my time getting through the first half of the book, and afterward, it flowed like water. This pattern continued on <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em>, and also <em>1Q84</em>. After taking a brief second look at the texts, the answer is obvious: Murakami spares no details, and describes images to the brink of banality. He doesn&#8217;t necessarily do this to create a clearer or more explicit description in his stories, because many of the details are forgettable. He writes lengthy descriptions of his scenes to make magic seem surprisingly normal.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t read much of Murakami&#8217;s work, I would recommend reading <em>Town of Cats</em>, which is an excerpt from <em>1Q84</em> that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/09/05/110905fi_fiction_murakami?currentPage=all">was published in The New Yorker</a> in 2011. Just the excerpt itself contains a story within a story. <em>1Q84</em> follows events surrounding the lives of two people, Tengo and Aomame. Tengo is a writer, and Aomame is a fitness instructor who also assassinates abusive males in her free time (this is one example of a detail that is mentioned so many times that it feels ordinary by the end of the book). The book constructs a new reality with a lot of self-referential symbolism, beginning with side characters as mundane as a taxi driver.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;And also,&#8221; the driver said, facing the mirror, &#8220;please remember: things are not what they seem.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Things are not what they seem</em>, Aomame repeated mentally. &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; she asked with knitted brows.</p>

<p>The driver chose his words carefully: &#8220;It&#8217;s just that you&#8217;re about to do something <em>out of the ordinary</em>. Am I right? People do not ordinarily climb down the emergency stairs of the Metropolitan Expressway in the middle of the day &#8211; especially women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. And after you <em>do</em> something like that, the everyday <em>look</em> of things might seem to change a little. Things may look <em>different</em> to you than they did before. I&#8217;ve had that experience myself. But don&#8217;t let appearances fool you. There&#8217;s always only one reality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the emphasis on the words is <em>not</em> mine.</p>

<p>This is followed later in the book by:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m not afraid to die</em>, Aomame reassured herself. <em>What I&#8217;m afraid of is having reality get the better of me, of having reality leave me behind</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another example, involving Tengo sitting in a playground, is just as interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>He could find nothing about it that seemed odd or unusual &#8211; no Queen of Hearts, no walrus, no Mad Hatter. There was nothing in his surroundings but an empty sandbox and swings, a mercury-vapor lamp emitting its sterile light, the spreading branches of a zalkova tree, a locked public toilet, a new six-story condo (only four units of which had lighted windows), a ward notice board, a red parked old-model green Volkswagen Golf, telephone poles and electric lines, and primary-color neon signs in the distance. The usual city noise, the usual lights.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you examine the constructed reality of the novel, the characters are doing the same as well, and they do so with reference to Chekhov.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to Chekhov,&#8221; Tamaru said, rising from his chair, &#8220;once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tamaru stood facing Aomame directly. He was only an inch or two taller than she was. &#8220;Meaning, don&#8217;t bring unnecessary props into a story. If a pistol appears, it has to be fired at some point. Chekhov liked to write stories that did away with all useless ornamentation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aomame straightened the sleeves of her dress and slung her bag over her shoulder. &#8220;And that worries you &#8211; if a pistol comes on the scene, it&#8217;s shure to be fired at some point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Chekhov&#8217;s view, yes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The reference to the Russian writer resurfaces later:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were too many questions. It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Murakami is telling you to look for questions &#8211; he wants you to figure out how art reframes your perception. 1Q84 asks, and almost begs, &#8220;What impact does fiction have on the <em>real world</em>?&#8221;</p>
