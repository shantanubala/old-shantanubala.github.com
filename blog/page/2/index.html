  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forgot to write a post yesterday.</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>

<p>I wanted to get in the habit of writing <em>something</em>, even if it was a crappy
sentence or two, or a repost of something I found online, or a quote of
something trite. Instead, I posted nothing yesterday.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s tricky. How do I motivate myself to write everyday? How should I do it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try the following, and see what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>write every day <em>immediately after breakfast</em></li>
<li>set a small goal of 5 sentences</li>
<li>write about anything, even something as trivial as how I feel or what I ate
for breakfast</li>
<li>write until ideas stop flowing</li>
<li>publish immediately, and edit later during the day when I&#8217;m bored</li>
</ul>


<p>Before, I simply had a perpetual &#8220;todo&#8221; with &#8220;write a blogpost,&#8221; and I would
find ways to procrastinate. Hopefully I can hold myself to higher
accountability!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first read about the research of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman">Martin Seligman</a>, I was skeptical. He
is famous for coming up with the concept of &#8220;learned helplessness,&#8221; but more
recently has been instrumental in forming a type of psychology known as
positive psychology. Positive psychology is all about using behavior as a way
to produce positive changes in mood. It&#8217;s the opposite of learned helplessness:
learned optimism.</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/flourish">his speech at the RSA</a>, and
started doing a simple daily exercise he recommends: writing down 3 good things that
happened during the day and why they happened.</p>

<p>That simple exercise has produced lower levels of depression and higher levels
of psychological well-being in placebo-controlled studies. It&#8217;s so simple that
it almost feels a little silly while doing it, but I recommend trying it out.
It quickly becomes engaging, and it is really interesting to go back in time
and smile at the things that made me happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve wanted to start doing time tracking for years, but I could never pick up
the habit. It was always really difficult to keep things organized. I didn&#8217;t
ever want to spend money on a tool that I would stop using, and I didn&#8217;t like
using Excel, handwritten notes, or a text file.</p>

<p>I started using Google Forms when it came out, and I can say now with
confidence that it is one of the best ways to do time tracking because it
allows you to customize the fields to your liking. I track how much sleep I
get, how many hours I spend on work, how many books I read, and many other
variables. It can go beyond time tracking: I even use it as a tool for
journaling.</p>

<p>All I do is have an email reminder sent to my inbox every day with a link to
the form I created. Since the form is linked to a spreadsheet, Google gives
instant visualizations of data, including bar charts, pie charts, and other
simple graphics that keep me motivated.</p>

<p>Sometimes, really simple general purpose tools can be really effective with the
right customizations. I&#8217;d recommend taking a look at the &#8220;Forms&#8221; feature of
<a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emilien Ghomi from the Université Paris-Sud received a <em>best paper</em> award at
the 2012 ACM CHI (Human-Computer Interaction) conference last year for a paper
describing the effectiveness of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Using+Rhythmic+Patterns+as+an+Input+Method&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Ghomi">using rhythmic patterns as an input method</a>.</p>

<p>The motiation for the research was simple: rhythm is a natural part of life.
Recognizing and reproducing rhythms is considered a fundamental human ability,
by psychologists, and it could prove to be an effective input method in a
computer interface. Games are an excellent example of using rhythm as input,
especially when the games are music-related (e.g. Guitar Hero). Physiological
psychologists have determined that humans have an innate sense of rhythm, and
in Human-Computer Interaction, existing interfaces use timing to distinguish
between different types of user behaviors (e.g. a double click on a mouse).</p>

<p>The primary advantage of rhythmic input involve its simplicity: unlike
gestures, rhythmic input requires very little space and can be detected very
accurately.</p>

<p>The researchers conducted two experiments, the first of which involved 12
participants (5 of whom never had any experience playing music) who were
instructed to repeat rhythmic patterns on the touchpad of a 13-inch MacBook
that were displayed to them using a static graphic, visual animation, and audio
representation. Additionally, participants were given different types of
feedback to facilitate learning. The overall success rate was 64.3%, but the
researchers note that the recognizer used in the experiment was very strict. In
practice, a much higher accuracy rate could be obtained by reducing the
vocabulary of rhythms and increasing the margin of error for allowed input. A
second experiment testing the recall rate of rhythms associated with
different commands resulted in an initial recall rate of 74%, but an improved
recall rate of 93% in a later test.</p>

<p>The most interesting applications of rhythmic input seem to be in mobile
devices, like smartphones and tablets with built-in touchscreens. So far,
gestures have been the primary input method (swipe, pinch, etc.), but rhythms
may be an effective method of user input in situations where a person is not
looking directly at the screen or the touchscreen itself is obscured (the
rhythms may be captured using an accelerometer).</p>

<p>The medium used for expression has an effect on the nature of the expression
itself. Like a dream, any creative work is simultaneously created and perceived
at the same time with each preceding brush stroke, word, or step influencing
the direction of the next.</p>

<p>When you experience something created by another person, you are transported
into their reality, a world governed by their rules.
Ultimately, these worlds on their own have no use or purpose, but even reality
has no intrinsic use or purpose. The true significance is their effects on us.</p>

<p>Even though you understand yourself through your thoughts, reality understands
you through actions. It is your choice to walk away from a spinning top.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/">this article</a> on Fox News.</p>

<blockquote><p>As the author of three books on the American family and its intersection with pop culture, I’ve spent thirteen years examining social agendas as they pertain to sex, parenting, and gender roles. During this time, I’ve spoken with hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women. And in doing so, I’ve accidentally stumbled upon a subculture of men who’ve told me, in no uncertain terms, that they’re never getting married. When I ask them why, the answer is always the same.</p>

<p>Women aren’t women anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>How do they know so confidently that &#8220;women aren&#8217;t women anymore&#8221; if they&#8217;ve never been married? Actually, the word &#8220;never&#8221; is important: this demographic of men is probably too young to even remember what women <em>were</em> to begin with. If a man is well over 40, <em>never</em> getting married will be discussed in the <em>past tense</em>, and it&#8217;s only these men who have any right to say something about what women were like in a previous generation. If a person was not alive, how would they know what women <em>were</em> like?</p>

<p>The alternate explanation: this has nothing to do with the current generation of women, and everything to do with the men she&#8217;s interviewing. &#8220;Women aren&#8217;t women anymore&#8221; just requires less self-analysis and an unbruised ego.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is the conclusion of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/neuroscience-under-attack.html?hpw&amp;_r=0">this article</a> from the New York Times.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s not hard to understand why neuroscience is so appealing. We all seek shortcuts to enlightenment. It’s reassuring to believe that brain images and machine analysis will reveal the fundamental truth about our minds and their contents. But as the neuro doubters make plain, we may be asking too much of neuroscience, expecting that its explanations will be definitive. Yet it’s hard to imagine that any functional magnetic resonance imaging or chemical map will ever explain “The Golden Bowl” or heaven. Or that brain imaging, no matter how sophisticated and precise, will ever tell us what women really want.</p></blockquote>

<p>The golden rule of a shoddy argument: too many qualifiers.</p>

<p>Aside from the way the discussion is framed, the article also fails to point out a simple fact: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a>. When you find out that Republicans have different brain chemsitry than Democrats, your assumption shouldn&#8217;t automatically be that they were <em>born that way</em>. Our brain &#8220;rewires&#8221; itself according to the stimuli it receives. That&#8217;s what makes the brain powerful from the start.</p>

<p>The discussion starts and ends with one sentence: correlation is not causation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I first became cursed with a mild obsession with Haruki Murakami after reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, a novel that slowly and progressively redefined reality within the boundaries of its plot. I&#8217;m not new to magical realism, and I consider <em>Midnight&#8217;s Children</em> and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> to be among my favorite books, but my appreciation for Murakami&#8217;s novels stems from an aspect of his writing that differs slightly from Rushdie or Marquez. With <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, I spent a majority of my time getting through the first half of the book, and afterward, it flowed like water. This pattern continued on <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em>, and also <em>1Q84</em>. After taking a brief second look at the texts, the answer is obvious: Murakami spares no details, and describes images to the brink of banality. He doesn&#8217;t necessarily do this to create a clearer or more explicit description in his stories, because many of the details are forgettable. He writes lengthy descriptions of his scenes to make magic seem surprisingly normal.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t read much of Murakami&#8217;s work, I would recommend reading <em>Town of Cats</em>, which is an excerpt from <em>1Q84</em> that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/09/05/110905fi_fiction_murakami?currentPage=all">was published in The New Yorker</a> in 2011. Just the excerpt itself contains a story within a story. <em>1Q84</em> follows events surrounding the lives of two people, Tengo and Aomame. Tengo is a writer, and Aomame is a fitness instructor who also assassinates abusive males in her free time (this is one example of a detail that is mentioned so many times that it feels ordinary by the end of the book). The book constructs a new reality with a lot of self-referential symbolism, beginning with side characters as mundane as a taxi driver.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;And also,&#8221; the driver said, facing the mirror, &#8220;please remember: things are not what they seem.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Things are not what they seem</em>, Aomame repeated mentally. &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; she asked with knitted brows.</p>

<p>The driver chose his words carefully: &#8220;It&#8217;s just that you&#8217;re about to do something <em>out of the ordinary</em>. Am I right? People do not ordinarily climb down the emergency stairs of the Metropolitan Expressway in the middle of the day &#8211; especially women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. And after you <em>do</em> something like that, the everyday <em>look</em> of things might seem to change a little. Things may look <em>different</em> to you than they did before. I&#8217;ve had that experience myself. But don&#8217;t let appearances fool you. There&#8217;s always only one reality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the emphasis on the words is <em>not</em> mine.</p>

<p>This is followed later in the book by:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m not afraid to die</em>, Aomame reassured herself. <em>What I&#8217;m afraid of is having reality get the better of me, of having reality leave me behind</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another example, involving Tengo sitting in a playground, is just as interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>He could find nothing about it that seemed odd or unusual &#8211; no Queen of Hearts, no walrus, no Mad Hatter. There was nothing in his surroundings but an empty sandbox and swings, a mercury-vapor lamp emitting its sterile light, the spreading branches of a zalkova tree, a locked public toilet, a new six-story condo (only four units of which had lighted windows), a ward notice board, a red parked old-model green Volkswagen Golf, telephone poles and electric lines, and primary-color neon signs in the distance. The usual city noise, the usual lights.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you examine the constructed reality of the novel, the characters are doing the same as well, and they do so with reference to Chekhov.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to Chekhov,&#8221; Tamaru said, rising from his chair, &#8220;once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tamaru stood facing Aomame directly. He was only an inch or two taller than she was. &#8220;Meaning, don&#8217;t bring unnecessary props into a story. If a pistol appears, it has to be fired at some point. Chekhov liked to write stories that did away with all useless ornamentation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aomame straightened the sleeves of her dress and slung her bag over her shoulder. &#8220;And that worries you &#8211; if a pistol comes on the scene, it&#8217;s shure to be fired at some point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Chekhov&#8217;s view, yes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The reference to the Russian writer resurfaces later:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were too many questions. It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Murakami is telling you to look for questions &#8211; he wants you to figure out how art reframes your perception. 1Q84 asks, and almost begs, &#8220;What impact does fiction have on the <em>real world</em>?&#8221;</p>
