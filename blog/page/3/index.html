  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr. Feynman</em> by Richard Feynman is one of the best
autobiographical books I have ever read. The brilliance of the book is its
seeming lack of structure - Feynman simply jumps between different stories
about his life, but the end result is fascinating. Richard Feynman is possibly
one of the most interesting people to have lived, and this book is good
evidence for that.</p>

<blockquote><p>The electron is a theory we use; it is so useful in understanding the way
nature works that we can almost call it real.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are gems hidden in the book like the above quote. It seems like an
ordinary statement, but hidden inside of it is something really profound:
Feynman is able to put very complex ideas into simple words. He is describing
the difference between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Map_and_the_Territory">map and the territory</a>
without invoking age-old philosophical discussions. Instead, he uses a
semicolon.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I
wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It&#8217;s
difficult to describe because it&#8217;s an emotion. It&#8217;s analogous to the feeling
one has in religion that has to do with a god that controls everything in the
whole universe: there&#8217;s a generality aspect that you feel when you think
about how things that appear so different and behave so differently are all
run &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; by the same organization, the same physical laws.
It&#8217;s an appreciation of the mathematical beauty of nature, of how she works
inside; a realization that the phenomena we see result from the complexity of
the inner workings between atoms; a feeling of how dramatic and wonderful it
is. It&#8217;s a feeling of awe — of scientific awe — which I felt could be
communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had this emotion. It
could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the
universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Behind Feynman&#8217;s life is a desire to discover the world and bottle it within
his mind. It appears that the book isn&#8217;t just intended as a way to store his
memories. Instead, he closes the novel with a speech he wrote encouraging
students to find environments in which their curiosity can flourish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most exciting things about Facebook Home is that Facebook is
releasing a phone in partnership with HTC.</p>

<p>Although I don’t personally use a smart phone, it is fascinating to think about
the change this could bring.</p>

<p>SMS used to be a big deal before the iPhone. It’s only very recently that
social networking has taken over communication, although SMS is still used for
communication that needs to be instant.</p>

<p>The key question for the future: how much will the lines between phone calls,
SMS, and Facebook messaging blur? How long will it take before Facebook
establishes itself as an identity on the same level as a phone number?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Planet Money is an excellent podcast, and there was an episode a few months ago when <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/21/167802325/episode-425-an-fbi-hostage-negotiator-buys-a-car">a hostage negotiator bought a car</a>.</p>

<p>Negotiation is an interesting game of psychology. The episode outlines
different kinds of tactics, like asking for multiple small things individually
to slowly tip the negotiation in your favor. Another tactic was to increase the
&#8220;size of the pie&#8221; by negotiating for things that have more value to you than
the person you are negotiating with.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S0qjK3TWZE8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The above scenario is a little different, but involves similar concepts. It&#8217;s a
variation on the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma. The video is worth a watch, and has
spurred some <a href="http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/index.php/economics/comments/game-show-game-theory">fascinating economic analysis</a>.</p>

<p>In the above variation of the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, two participants are forced
to choose (without knowing the other person&#8217;s choice) to either split a prize
or steal it. If they both choose to split, they both receive half of the prize.
If one chooses to steal while the other chooses to split, the person who steals
receives the full quantity of the prize. If they both choose to steal, they
lose the entire prize.</p>

<p>The participant in the video changed the rules of the game: instead of playing
the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, he bent the rules and removed the &#8220;dilemma&#8221; for the
other player.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the best way to negotiate is to step outside of the ordinary
interpretation of the way <em>things are supposed to be</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forgot to write a post yesterday.</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>

<p>I wanted to get in the habit of writing <em>something</em>, even if it was a crappy
sentence or two, or a repost of something I found online, or a quote of
something trite. Instead, I posted nothing yesterday.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s tricky. How do I motivate myself to write everyday? How should I do it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try the following, and see what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>write every day <em>immediately after breakfast</em></li>
<li>set a small goal of 5 sentences</li>
<li>write about anything, even something as trivial as how I feel or what I ate
for breakfast</li>
<li>write until ideas stop flowing</li>
<li>publish immediately, and edit later during the day when I&#8217;m bored</li>
</ul>


<p>Before, I simply had a perpetual &#8220;todo&#8221; with &#8220;write a blogpost,&#8221; and I would
find ways to procrastinate. Hopefully I can hold myself to higher
accountability!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first read about the research of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman">Martin Seligman</a>, I was skeptical. He
is famous for coming up with the concept of &#8220;learned helplessness,&#8221; but more
recently has been instrumental in forming a type of psychology known as
positive psychology. Positive psychology is all about using behavior as a way
to produce positive changes in mood. It&#8217;s the opposite of learned helplessness:
learned optimism.</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/flourish">his speech at the RSA</a>, and
started doing a simple daily exercise he recommends: writing down 3 good things that
happened during the day and why they happened.</p>

<p>That simple exercise has produced lower levels of depression and higher levels
of psychological well-being in placebo-controlled studies. It&#8217;s so simple that
it almost feels a little silly while doing it, but I recommend trying it out.
It quickly becomes engaging, and it is really interesting to go back in time
and smile at the things that made me happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve wanted to start doing time tracking for years, but I could never pick up
the habit. It was always really difficult to keep things organized. I didn&#8217;t
ever want to spend money on a tool that I would stop using, and I didn&#8217;t like
using Excel, handwritten notes, or a text file.</p>

<p>I started using Google Forms when it came out, and I can say now with
confidence that it is one of the best ways to do time tracking because it
allows you to customize the fields to your liking. I track how much sleep I
get, how many hours I spend on work, how many books I read, and many other
variables. It can go beyond time tracking: I even use it as a tool for
journaling.</p>

<p>All I do is have an email reminder sent to my inbox every day with a link to
the form I created. Since the form is linked to a spreadsheet, Google gives
instant visualizations of data, including bar charts, pie charts, and other
simple graphics that keep me motivated.</p>

<p>Sometimes, really simple general purpose tools can be really effective with the
right customizations. I&#8217;d recommend taking a look at the &#8220;Forms&#8221; feature of
<a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emilien Ghomi from the Université Paris-Sud received a <em>best paper</em> award at
the 2012 ACM CHI (Human-Computer Interaction) conference last year for a paper
describing the effectiveness of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Using+Rhythmic+Patterns+as+an+Input+Method&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Ghomi">using rhythmic patterns as an input method</a>.</p>

<p>The motiation for the research was simple: rhythm is a natural part of life.
Recognizing and reproducing rhythms is considered a fundamental human ability,
by psychologists, and it could prove to be an effective input method in a
computer interface. Games are an excellent example of using rhythm as input,
especially when the games are music-related (e.g. Guitar Hero). Physiological
psychologists have determined that humans have an innate sense of rhythm, and
in Human-Computer Interaction, existing interfaces use timing to distinguish
between different types of user behaviors (e.g. a double click on a mouse).</p>

<p>The primary advantage of rhythmic input involve its simplicity: unlike
gestures, rhythmic input requires very little space and can be detected very
accurately.</p>

<p>The researchers conducted two experiments, the first of which involved 12
participants (5 of whom never had any experience playing music) who were
instructed to repeat rhythmic patterns on the touchpad of a 13-inch MacBook
that were displayed to them using a static graphic, visual animation, and audio
representation. Additionally, participants were given different types of
feedback to facilitate learning. The overall success rate was 64.3%, but the
researchers note that the recognizer used in the experiment was very strict. In
practice, a much higher accuracy rate could be obtained by reducing the
vocabulary of rhythms and increasing the margin of error for allowed input. A
second experiment testing the recall rate of rhythms associated with
different commands resulted in an initial recall rate of 74%, but an improved
recall rate of 93% in a later test.</p>

<p>The most interesting applications of rhythmic input seem to be in mobile
devices, like smartphones and tablets with built-in touchscreens. So far,
gestures have been the primary input method (swipe, pinch, etc.), but rhythms
may be an effective method of user input in situations where a person is not
looking directly at the screen or the touchscreen itself is obscured (the
rhythms may be captured using an accelerometer).</p>

<p>The medium used for expression has an effect on the nature of the expression
itself. Like a dream, any creative work is simultaneously created and perceived
at the same time with each preceding brush stroke, word, or step influencing
the direction of the next.</p>

<p>When you experience something created by another person, you are transported
into their reality, a world governed by their rules.
Ultimately, these worlds on their own have no use or purpose, but even reality
has no intrinsic use or purpose. The true significance is their effects on us.</p>

<p>Even though you understand yourself through your thoughts, reality understands
you through actions. It is your choice to walk away from a spinning top.</p>
