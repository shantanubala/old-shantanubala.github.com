<p>I particularly enjoyed this talk:</p>

<p>And I particularly enjoy this quote from <em>Midnight&#8217;s Children</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before
me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone
everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am
anything that happens after I&#8217;ve gone which would not have happened if I had
not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each &#8220;I,&#8221; every
one of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude.
I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you&#8217;ll have to swallow a world.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The specific project I was evaluating had only gotten $800,000 out of the
maximum $2m. Its strategy was to purchase the male students iPod Touches, the
female students makeovers, manicures, and pedicures at a local beauty parlor,
and all students were offered an additional iPod Touch or Makeover,
respectively, if they passed the exam at the end of the current year. The
grant proposal had specifically listed these actions as being the goal of the
proposal. If the iPods and makeovers were purchased, that constituted
success.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was from a LessWrong article about the
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/h5z/problems_in_education/">problems with education</a>.</p>

<p>Although this article outlines the problems with the way funds are distributed
to our schools through grants, it is a problem with human nature.</p>

<p>Once we create a solution to a problem, we judge the success of our endeavours
by the success with which we execute our solution instead of judging based on
the <em>metrics that define the problem</em>.</p>

<p>The short answer: measure everything, and evaluate results based on the
evidence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished re-reading all of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#8217;s Harry Potter fanfic -
<a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>. After reading
it again, I have a new appreciation for what Eliezer is attempting.</p>

<p>Writing fan fiction based on a series as popular as Harry Potter allows Eliezer
to construct a new world from existing parts. Instead of having to spend
enormous amounts of time establishing the histories and personalities of his
characters, he can focus only on the parts that are <em>different</em> from the
original work. It is through these differences that Eliezer is able to explain
seemingly-complex concepts involving Bayesian Rationality, quantum mechanics,
cognitive biases, and psychology.</p>

<p>The references to science seem forced at times, but the underlying story is
gripping in a way that is very different from J.K. Rowling&#8217;s writing. Eliezer
has elevated the art of fan fiction to a different level - instead of just
constructing a story that extends the original, he constructs a story that
transcends it.</p>

<p>Give it a shot. It&#8217;s worth reading.</p>

<time datetime="2013-04-10T23:19:00+12:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 10<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished re-reading <em>Musashi</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa. It is possibly my
favorite book, and I will write a more comprehensive book review another time.
For now, I just wanted to share a few quotes that I thought were golden.</p>

<p>If you are striving to improve yourself to a point of perfection, read
<em>Musashi</em>. If you are interested in martial arts, read <em>Musashi</em>. If you enjoy
reading books, read <em>Musashi</em>. It is a gripping story that is written with wit
and wisdom.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ah, even I&#8217;m beginning to think priests are crazy. Everywhere they go, they
meet no one but people rushing toward hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not so distant from the gods and the universe. I can touch them with the
three-foot sword I carry. But not so long as I feel there is a distinction
between nature and humankind. Not so long as I remain distant from the realm
of the true expert, the fully developed man.&#8221;</p>

<p>You seem to be under the misconception that if you perform one brave deed,
that alone makes you a samurai. Well it doesn&#8217;t! you let that one act of
loyalty convince you of your righteousness. The more convinced you became,
the more harm you caused yourself and everyone else.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Musashi&#8217;s own (non-fiction) <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories were
not due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural ability, or
the order of heaven, or that other schools&#8217; strategy was inferior. After that
I studied morning and evening searching for the principle, and came to
realise the Way of strategy when I was fifty. Since then I have lived without
following any particular Way. Thus with the virtue of strategy I practise
many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher. To write this book I
did not use the law of Buddha or the teachings of Confucius, neither old war
chronicles nor books on martial tactics. I take up my brush to explain the
true spirit of this Ichi school as it is mirrored in the Way of heaven and
Kwannon. The time is the night of the tenth day of the tenth month, at the
hour of the tiger.</p></blockquote>

<p>I still feel like I haven&#8217;t encapsulated the essence of it all. I&#8217;ll try again
tomorrow&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just recently stubmled across <a href="http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/">The Ancient World</a>,
a podcast about ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to really enjoy learning about history through audio, and this
podcast brilliantly describes Ancient Mesopotamia really well, and it is still
being updated with new episodes!</p>

<p>There are two (no longer updated) podcasts that are still worth listening to:
<a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh">Hardcore History</a> and
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome</a>.</p>

<p>Learning about history can be fascinating for a simple (and trite) reason: past
events often resemble our present predicaments.</p>

<p>One such example is the life of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a>,
a general in Rome over 2,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Sulla was one of the first to break the rules of the constitution of the Roman
Republic in an effort to <em>preserve the values of the constitution</em>.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> by Joshua Foer is an excellent book. Although you
can watch his TED talk to get a quick summary of the book&#8217;s main ideas, I would
highly recommend reading the book.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/U6PoUg7jXsA"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The book details his journey from being an ordinary journalist to a memory
champion - he went from having average memory to being able to memorize
thousand-digit numbers with ease. The most startling part of the entire book:
anyone can perform the same tricks with an average memory.</p>

<p>The memory techniques definitely seem like <em>tricks</em>, but they are very
effective, and date back to Cicero&#8217;s speeches in the Roman Senate.</p>

<p>Although the specific techniques, like using spatial memory to remember
different details, are interesting, there is another profound aspect to the
book that cannot be overstated: simply because something appears to be
extraordinary does not mean you have to be extraordinary to do it. At first
glance, the ability to memorize thousands of random digits seems like it would
require <em>genius</em>, when it truly just requires focus and practice.</p>

<p>If there is one important lesson to gain from the book, it is that focus and
deliberate practice can produce seemingly superhuman results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr. Feynman</em> by Richard Feynman is one of the best
autobiographical books I have ever read. The brilliance of the book is its
seeming lack of structure - Feynman simply jumps between different stories
about his life, but the end result is fascinating. Richard Feynman is possibly
one of the most interesting people to have lived, and this book is good
evidence for that.</p>

<blockquote><p>The electron is a theory we use; it is so useful in understanding the way
nature works that we can almost call it real.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are gems hidden in the book like the above quote. It seems like an
ordinary statement, but hidden inside of it is something really profound:
Feynman is able to put very complex ideas into simple words. He is describing
the difference between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Map_and_the_Territory">map and the territory</a>
without invoking age-old philosophical discussions. Instead, he uses a
semicolon.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I
wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It&#8217;s
difficult to describe because it&#8217;s an emotion. It&#8217;s analogous to the feeling
one has in religion that has to do with a god that controls everything in the
whole universe: there&#8217;s a generality aspect that you feel when you think
about how things that appear so different and behave so differently are all
run &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; by the same organization, the same physical laws.
It&#8217;s an appreciation of the mathematical beauty of nature, of how she works
inside; a realization that the phenomena we see result from the complexity of
the inner workings between atoms; a feeling of how dramatic and wonderful it
is. It&#8217;s a feeling of awe — of scientific awe — which I felt could be
communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had this emotion. It
could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the
universe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Behind Feynman&#8217;s life is a desire to discover the world and bottle it within
his mind. It appears that the book isn&#8217;t just intended as a way to store his
memories. Instead, he closes the novel with a speech he wrote encouraging
students to find environments in which their curiosity can flourish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most exciting things about Facebook Home is that Facebook is
releasing a phone in partnership with HTC.</p>

<p>Although I don’t personally use a smart phone, it is fascinating to think about
the change this could bring.</p>

<p>SMS used to be a big deal before the iPhone. It’s only very recently that
social networking has taken over communication, although SMS is still used for
communication that needs to be instant.</p>

<p>The key question for the future: how much will the lines between phone calls,
SMS, and Facebook messaging blur? How long will it take before Facebook
establishes itself as an identity on the same level as a phone number?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Planet Money is an excellent podcast, and there was an episode a few months ago when <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/21/167802325/episode-425-an-fbi-hostage-negotiator-buys-a-car">a hostage negotiator bought a car</a>.</p>

<p>Negotiation is an interesting game of psychology. The episode outlines
different kinds of tactics, like asking for multiple small things individually
to slowly tip the negotiation in your favor. Another tactic was to increase the
&#8220;size of the pie&#8221; by negotiating for things that have more value to you than
the person you are negotiating with.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S0qjK3TWZE8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The above scenario is a little different, but involves similar concepts. It&#8217;s a
variation on the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma. The video is worth a watch, and has
spurred some <a href="http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/index.php/economics/comments/game-show-game-theory">fascinating economic analysis</a>.</p>

<p>In the above variation of the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, two participants are forced
to choose (without knowing the other person&#8217;s choice) to either split a prize
or steal it. If they both choose to split, they both receive half of the prize.
If one chooses to steal while the other chooses to split, the person who steals
receives the full quantity of the prize. If they both choose to steal, they
lose the entire prize.</p>

<p>The participant in the video changed the rules of the game: instead of playing
the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, he bent the rules and removed the &#8220;dilemma&#8221; for the
other player.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the best way to negotiate is to step outside of the ordinary
interpretation of the way <em>things are supposed to be</em>.</p>
