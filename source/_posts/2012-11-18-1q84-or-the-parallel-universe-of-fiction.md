I first became cursed with a mild obsession with Haruki Murakami after reading _Kafka on the Shore_, a novel that slowly and progressively redefined reality within the boundaries of its plot. I'm not new to magical realism, and I consider _Midnight's Children_ and _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ to be among my favorite books, but my appreciation for Murakami's novels stems from an aspect of his writing that differs slightly from Rushdie or Marquez. With _Kafka on the Shore_, I spent a majority of my time getting through the first half of the book, and afterward, it flowed like water. This pattern continued on _Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_, and also _1Q84_. After taking a brief second look at the texts, the answer is obvious: Murakami spares no details, and describes images to the brink of banality. He doesn't necessarily do this to create a clearer or more explicit description in his stories, because many of the details are forgettable. He writes lengthy descriptions of his scenes to make magic seem surprisingly normal.

If you haven't read much of Murakami's work, I would recommend reading *Town of Cats*, which is an excerpt from *1Q84* that [was published in The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/09/05/110905fi_fiction_murakami?currentPage=all) in 2011. Just the excerpt itself contains a story within a story. *1Q84* follows events surrounding the lives of two people, Tengo and Aomame. Tengo is a writer, and Aomame is a fitness instructor who also assassinates abusive males in her free time (this is one example of a detail that is mentioned so many times that it feels ordinary by the end of the book). The book constructs a new reality with a lot of self-referential symbolism, beginning with side characters as mundane as a taxi driver.

> "And also," the driver said, facing the mirror, "please remember: things are not what they seem."
>
> *Things are not what they seem*, Aomame repeated mentally. "What do you mean by that?" she asked with knitted brows.
>
> The driver chose his words carefully: "It's just that you're about to do something *out of the ordinary*. Am I right? People do not ordinarily climb down the emergency stairs of the Metropolitan Expressway in the middle of the day -- especially women."
>
> "I suppose you're right."
>
> "Right. And after you *do* something like that, the everyday *look* of things might seem to change a little. Things may look *different* to you than they did before. I've had that experience myself. But don't let appearances fool you. There's always only one reality."

Note that the emphasis on the words is *not* mine.

This is followed later in the book by:

> *I'm not afraid to die*, Aomame reassured herself. *What I'm afraid of is having reality get the better of me, of having reality leave me behind*.

Another example, involving Tengo sitting in a playground, is just as interesting:

> He could find nothing about it that seemed odd or unusual -- no Queen of Hearts, no walrus, no Mad Hatter. There was nothing in his surroundings but an empty sandbox and swings, a mercury-vapor lamp emitting its sterile light, the spreading branches of a zalkova tree, a locked public toilet, a new six-story condo (only four units of which had lighted windows), a ward notice board, a red parked old-model green Volkswagen Golf, telephone poles and electric lines, and primary-color neon signs in the distance. The usual city noise, the usual lights.

As you examine the constructed reality of the novel, the characters are doing the same as well, and they do so with reference to Chekhov.

> "According to Chekhov," Tamaru said, rising from his chair, "once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired."
>
> "Meaning what?"
>
> Tamaru stood facing Aomame directly. He was only an inch or two taller than she was. "Meaning, don't bring unnecessary props into a story. If a pistol appears, it has to be fired at some point. Chekhov liked to write stories that did away with all useless ornamentation."
>
> Aomame straightened the sleeves of her dress and slung her bag over her shoulder. "And that worries you -- if a pistol comes on the scene, it's shure to be fired at some point."
>
> "In Chekhov's view, yes."

The reference to the Russian writer resurfaces later:

> There were too many questions. It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them.

Murakami is telling you to look for questions -- he wants you to figure out how art reframes your perception. 1Q84 asks, and almost begs, "What impact does fiction have on the *real world*?"
