<p>"Ab-Soul's Outro" from <em>Section 80</em> by Kendrick Lamar is a great example of
what rap music can accomplish.</p>

<p>Jazz has had an influence on rap even before NWA started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A#Influence">sampling jazz tunes in their beats</a>.
Improvisation is a key characteristic of jazz, and it also happens to be a key
part of the creative process for rap music. Unlike conventional poetry, rap
music aims to bend words to create a unique flow like jazz.</p>

<p>In "Ab-Soul's Outro," Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul acknowledge that influence by
featuring jazz prominently in the track itself. The producer of the song,
Terrace Martin, is also an excellent saxophonist who is featured throughout the
song and has a solo at the end of the track.</p>

<p>More than anything, these lines keep repeating in my head:</p>

<blockquote><p>What's your life about? Enlighten me.
Is you gonna live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gonna plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, child come on.</p></blockquote>
