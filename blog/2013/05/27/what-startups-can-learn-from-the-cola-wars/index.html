<div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m building <a href="https://ebookglue.com">my first company</a>, I&#8217;m constantly searching for inspiration in a variety of places: <a href="http://mixergy.com/">interviews</a>, <a href="http://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Titan.html?id=Mleb5acWQF4C&amp;redir_esc=y">biographies</a>, and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a>. Over time, I&#8217;ve found that analyzing rivalries between companies is the most interesting way to learn about strategy. It&#8217;s like watching two fighters in a ring to see who has better technique.</p>

<p>Why not look at one of the most famous consumer product rivalries in recent history? That&#8217;s right: Coke vs. Pepsi.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/coke-vs-pepsi.jpg" alt="Coke vs. Pepsi" /></p>

<h2>Split testing, not sip testing.</h2>

<p>Nearly 8 years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Challenge">Pepsi Challenge</a> in <em>Blink</em>. The Pepsi Challenge was a marketing campaign: instead of buying based on brand, PepsiCo &#8220;challenged&#8221; people to a blind taste test: take a sip of two colas and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>The verdict? People like Pepsi better than Coke. This caused a panic in Coke headquarters and resulted in one of the biggest flops of soft drink history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke">New Coke</a>, an attempt to reformulate Coca Cola to make it more appealing in taste tests.</p>

<p>If Pepsi was better, why did Coke keep its market share? If New Coke was more appealing in taste tests, why did people hate it?</p>

<p>As Gladwell points out, the sip test was a flawed methodology. It didn&#8217;t test <em>how much</em> of the soda people consumed. There is a difference between drinking an entire can of soda and drinking a few milliliters. Nobody purchases a can of soda only to take a sip and throw the rest away, but that was exactly the variable they were attempting to optimize.</p>

<p>In startups, A/B testing has become very popular. There are tools like <a href="http://optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/">Visual Web Site Optimizer</a>, and <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo">A/Bingo</a> that make the process extremely easy. But if the product you are creating involves more than just a single &#8220;buy now&#8221; button, you have to be very careful. Although A/B testing has become easier, testing true retention and engagement is a much more lengthy process that can take months to understand.</p>

<p>Testing is a powerful tool, but you have to make sure you aren&#8217;t administering sip tests when you&#8217;re trying to sell bottles.</p>

<h2>Do you actually need to reformulate?</h2>

<p>Coke was extremely popular in the 1980&#8217;s before New Coke was released in 1985. Coca Cola was making a product that people wanted and enjoyed. Coca Cola&#8217;s biggest mistake was assuming that customers wanted a better-tasting soda (on average) rather than the soda that they were already buying.</p>

<p>Technology companies make this mistake all the time: they look at competitors and think, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t we make that?&#8221; Microsoft had this response to Apple with the Zune, and Google recently had this response to Facebook with Google+.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s obvious from the third person: what differentiates a product is how it <em>differs</em> from the competition! Instead of trying to make &#8220;a better iPod,&#8221; Microsoft should have tried leveraging its own advantages (for example, Microsoft was excelling at console gaming with the Xbox) to find opportunities that Apple was missing or intentionally ignoring. Google+ Circles are an attempt to differentiate Google+ from Facebook by having a more realistic representation of our social lives, but will that be enough? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>The important point is that New Coke didn&#8217;t seem like a bad idea. The science <em>proved</em> it was superior, and the decisions appeared to be strategic. The hard part of finding success is learning to recognize our own failures before they actually take shape.</p>

<p>New Coke was undoubtedly the result of a few brainstorming sessions revolving around the topic, &#8220;How do we beat Pepsi?&#8221; When attempting to solve such a problem, it is also important to brainstorm, &#8220;How could this solution fail?&#8221;</p>

<h2>Consistency is underappreciated or overappreciated?</h2>

<p>People dislike change. Moreso, people dislike change when they don&#8217;t see the need for it.</p>

<p>New Coke was an unnecessary change. A consumer can understand that Coca Cola can no longer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola#Coca_.E2.80.93_cocaine">include cocaine</a> in their product due to DEA regulations, but a consumer will not sympathize with a &#8220;reformulation&#8221; unless the amount of value he or she gains exceeds the cost of switching to the new product.</p>

<p>Startups by definition have to move fast and constantly be iterating. Change is intrinsically part of the game: if you can&#8217;t change fast enough, you lose.</p>

<p>This presents an interesting situation: the average benefit of changes seems to scale linearly with the number of users, but the average cost of changes scales at a greater rate. In other words, there is a point where those two intersect. After that point, it becomes harder and harder to find changes that bring more value than they cost.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/cost-of-change.jpg" alt="Cost of Change vs. Expected Benefit" /></p>

<p>When Coca Cola came up with New Coke, they were already too far past the point of intersection.</p>

<h2>Branding has always been part of our social realities.</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=8388">A consumer research study on Coca Cola</a> has examined the behavior of people who collect Coca Cola products. An in-depth look at people visiting &#8220;the annual Coca-Cola Collectors Convention, three Coca-Cola collector-only events, and several brand specific retail outlets, including the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, Georgia and the Fifth Avenue Coca-Cola Store in New York City&#8221; has shown that &#8220;it isnâ€™t just the product they like, they like what the company stands for: &#8216;the Coca Cola mystique&#8217; as more than one collector deemed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>People expressed how Coca Cola is &#8220;tied to the American way of life.&#8221; The goal of any company should be to develop that level of loyalty. You cannot develop that just by making good products. You have to make people <em>happy</em> and allow them to feel like they are sharing culture.</p>

<p>This was, in part, why the Pepsi Challenge failed. Pepsi still doesn&#8217;t have a clear value statement. When I think of Pepsi, I don&#8217;t have other parts of my life that are embedded with the brand. When I think of Coca Cola, I think of iconic commercials with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj1oQ1tQ02M">football stars</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dHOzw5KSlE">beauty of everyday happiness</a>.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re making software, you don&#8217;t have to be as melodramatic.</p>

<p>Github is one of the most recent examples of a company that excels at creating culture. Everything down to the <a href="https://github.com/404">Github 404 page</a> has a unique <em>geekiness</em> to it, but more importantly, they actively encourage people to become part of the community. By embracing open source software projects, they encouraged people to integrate Github into their lives in a way that very few companies are able to. Nowadays, &#8220;open source&#8221; often implies &#8220;fork it on Github.&#8221; When I am about to start hacking on a project, the first thought is, &#8220;let&#8217;s make a Github repo.&#8221;</p>

<h2>There are multiple &#8220;perfect&#8221; flavors.</h2>

<p>Though Coca Cola &#8220;won&#8221; the cola war, PepsiCo is still a multi-billion dollar company that is here to stay.</p>

<p>Look a little further and you&#8217;ll see many other smaller brands that are still alive and profitable. Even no-name generic soft drinks will be purchased in a grocery store.</p>

<p>In the continuum of people&#8217;s preferences for cola, there are multiple spikes of different sizes. The goal of a company is to capitalize on one of the spikes.</p>

<p>In this sense, a startup seems to be like an attempt to navigate such a space. Sometimes, you&#8217;re in uncharted territory. Other times, you&#8217;re in an area with other people with the hope that you can climb faster and higher.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see how it goes.</p>
