Planet Money is an excellent podcast, and there was an episode a few months ago when [a hostage negotiator bought a car](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/21/167802325/episode-425-an-fbi-hostage-negotiator-buys-a-car).

Negotiation is an interesting game of psychology. The episode outlines
different kinds of tactics, like asking for multiple small things individually
to slowly tip the negotiation in your favor. Another tactic was to increase the
"size of the pie" by negotiating for things that have more value to you than
the person you are negotiating with.

The above scenario is a little different, but involves similar concepts. It's a
variation on the prisoner's dilemma. The video is worth a watch, and has
spurred some [fascinating economic analysis](http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/index.php/economics/comments/game-show-game-theory).

In the above variation of the prisoner's dilemma, two participants are forced
to choose (without knowing the other person's choice) to either split a prize
or steal it. If they both choose to split, they both receive half of the prize.
If one chooses to steal while the other chooses to split, the person who steals
receives the full quantity of the prize. If they both choose to steal, they
lose the entire prize.

The participant in the video changed the rules of the game: instead of playing
the prisoner's dilemma, he bent the rules and removed the "dilemma" for the
other player.

Sometimes, the best way to negotiate is to step outside of the ordinary
interpretation of the way *things are supposed to be*.
